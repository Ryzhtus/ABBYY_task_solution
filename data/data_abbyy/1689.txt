Twitter is the home of internet memes, but it turns out its most timeless joke is hiding in plain sight in its own interface. Scott Jehl, designer and developer at Boston design studio Filament Group, has shared a tweet that has since gone viral, though he wasn’t the creator of the joke. The gag comes straight from Twitter’s UI. In a GIF uploaded by Jehl, he moves his cursor over to “Show more replies” under a tweet, only for the text “More replies” to appear. The designer called the detail “Twitter’s best dad joke,” and thousands of Twitter users agree.

Whether you enjoy dad jokes or not, it’s received its desired response of either making people chuckle or roll their eyes.
