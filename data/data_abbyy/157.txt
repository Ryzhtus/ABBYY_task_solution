The November 7 article described the elected president’s decision to ignore the self-serving view of agency officials:
Trump was elected president on an America First platform, and he has had to fight the establishment every day to implement his platform.
Vox is part of the establishment, so Vox’s shocked report about politicians overruling experts provides a useful Civics 101 lesson for American K-12 students: Presidents with change agendas will face strenuous opposition from the establishment.
Other reports show how Trump has had to fight the establishment. The New York Times, for example, described a showdown in the Oval Office where Trump demanded more effort to block migrants:
In the following months, Trump revamped his staff, fired top aides, fended off appeals from business lobbies, and then achieved a huge strategic success by threatening to impose tariffs on Mexico.
The Vox article also showed how the State Department is focused on its own priorities and rarely is willing to help fix other national problems if those fixes create problems for the diplomats. That self-serving attitude was spotlighted by the diplomats’ arguments against Trump’s plan to end the migrants’ Temporary Protective Status (TPS), as described in Vox:
In October, Trump won a migrant-reduction deal with El Salvador by offering to partially extend TPS for El Salvadorean migrants now living in the United States. That diplomatic trade would not have been possible if the State Department’s do-nothing advice had been accepted by Trump.
Democrats expressed shock that politics played a role in Trump’s political decision:
But Vox also revealed the Democrats’ political strategy behind Menendez’s rehearsed shock about politics playing a role in politics:
Even if a judge blocks Trump’s TPS termination by declaring it to be “arbitrary and capricious,” Trump’s deputies will appeal the decision up to the Supreme Court.
