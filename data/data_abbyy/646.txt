WASHINGTON (AP) - The government says it has a new procedure in place for notifying victims of cyberattacks during the 2020 presidential election.
The goal is to be consistent in how victims and the public learn about instances of such election interference.
Officials say the Secret Service will be notified anytime a major presidential campaign is targeted. Decisions about whether to provide notification “will take into account the need to protect sensitive sources and methods necessary to protect national security and to avoid interfering in investigations.”
President Donald Trump signed off on what’s being call a new framework on Oct. 31.
