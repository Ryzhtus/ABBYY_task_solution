Ravichandran’s latest film Aa Drushya is scheduled to be released on November 8. For the first time, Ravichandran, who is known for running around trees with beautiful heroines, has neither a heroine nor a song in this film. “Ravichandran is playing a cop character. The audiences will see him in two get-ups — one as a 40-year-old, the other as a 55-year-old one. We have used graphics to make Ravichandran look young,’’ said director Shiva Ganesh. The director said a location near Moodbidri motivated him to write the script for Aa Drushya. “I had visited the location for another film, but it motivated me to write the script for this film. The beauty of the location is that one side of the location is full of coffee estates and the other side is tea gardens while a village is in the middle,’’ said Shiva Ganesh. Was it difficult to direct Ravichandran, who had handled megaphone for Kannada films, during the shooting? “Not at all. I too had some apprehension before the shooting. Ravichandran Sir was very cooperative and polite during the shooting. I was very happy and comfortable during the shooting of this film,’’ said the director. The film’s shooting was completed in 42 days at beautiful locations in Bengaluru, Chikkamagaluru, Moodibidri and Mysuru. Chaitra Achar and Nisarga Lakshman are playing important characters in this film. Well-known producer K Manju is producing this film. Achyuth Kumar, Yash Shetty and Ramesh Bhat are the other members of the cast. Gautam Srivatsav is the music director. The film has been produced under the banner of K Manju Cinemas.
