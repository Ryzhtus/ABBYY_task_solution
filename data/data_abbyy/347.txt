Deepfakes have become increasingly common and a potential problem, with even a readily-accessible app that allows you to place your face on celebrities. Now, an official music video has emerged showing Diplo and Niall Horan’s faces morphed together through deepfakes. The masterfully-made clip is for Diplo’s remix of the former One Direction member’s single, Nice To Meet Ya, producing an unsettlingly realistic “Diploran” with very few edit lines visible.
