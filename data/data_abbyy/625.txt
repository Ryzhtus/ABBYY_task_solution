KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 8): RHB Retail Research said Carimin Petroleum Bhd may rise higher after forming a white candle and hitting its new 52-week high.
In a trading stocks note today, the research house said this upward momentum is likely to continue given this is the second consecutive white candle.
“A positive bias may emerge above the RM1.33 level, with an exit set below the RM1.19 threshold.
“Towards the upside, the immediate resistance is at the RM1.50 mark. This is followed by the RM1.60 level,” it said.
