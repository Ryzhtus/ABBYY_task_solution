STOCKHOLM A Swedish team has salvaged hundreds of bottles of liquor from the wreck of a ship sunk during World War I in the Baltic Sea. Ocean X, a group that specialises in salvaging alcohol from shipwrecks, said it was testing the bottles from a cargo bound for Russia to see if they were still fit to drink. The group brought 600 bottles of cognac and 300 bottles of Benedictine – a herbal liqueur – to shore on October 22 after recovering them from the wreck of the Kyros, which was sunk by a German submarine in 1917. Bottles of the cognac, produced by the now-defunct distillers De Haartman, and the Benedictine are being tested in a laboratory. “The conditions in the Baltic are very suitable for storing these kind of beverages because it’s... dark and very cold,” said Peter Lindberg, who led the expedition. The Kyros left Sweden in May 1917 and was sunk in the Sea of Aland with an explosive charge.
