Jeff Lynne’s ELO (or simply ELO, or Electric Light Orchestra, for those who were there from the beginning) is back at No. 1 on the U.K. albums chart with their latest album From Out of Nowhere, which debuts atop the list...though it’s arrival is met with some controversy.The title is the band’s fourth chart-topper in their home country. They first summited the list in 1979 with Discover, and they repeated that success two years later with their follow-up, Time. In an incredible show of sustained popularity (and how one major festival appearance can change everything in an instant), the group’s greatest hits compilation All Over the World - The Very Best Of shot to No. 1 three years ago. That release had already been out for over a decade, but a headlining spot at Glastonbury convinced enough people to rush to buy the project, and it made waves not long after.
From Out of Nowhere is ELO’s eleventh top 10 album in the nation.
Early this frame, the Official Charts Company reported that another new release was headed straight to the top of the ranking and that it wasn’t even a close race. BBC Children in Need: Got It Covered, a collection of covers of popular songs by famous actors (such as Olivia Colman, David Tennant and Helena Bonham Carter) recorded and sold to raise money to benefit children’s causes, was predicted to win the week, but just a day ago, the chart compilers changed their thinking, upsetting many in the process.
Apparently, BBC Children in Need: Got It Covered counts as a compilation by various artists, not a proper album, so it isn’t eligible for the main chart (according to U.K. rules). The set may have been the best-performing title this week, but it was robbed of a chance to rule in proper fashion, though it was still a major success when it comes to bringing in much-needed funds.
