Topline: Alibaba is gearing up for a share offering in Hong Kong later this month as it looks to raise up to $15 billion in a secondary listing. The move would be a boost for the financial hub rocked by months of unrest that have tipped it into recession.
Key background: Alibaba has been planning its listing in Hong Kong for months, but pulled back in August amid unrelenting protests. The unrest has resulted in Hong Kong’s economy shrinking for two straight quarters, with GDP falling by 3.2% in the three months to September. Retailers are among firms that have been impacted the most while, in contrast, Alibaba reported a 40% growth in revenue in its second quarter to nearly $17 billion.
Additional fact: The listing would come after Singles Day on November 11, Alibaba’s biggest trading day and mainland China’s biggest shopping day. The firm made $30 billion last year in the event.
Tangent: On Thursday, 22-year-old student Alex Chow died after he fell from a car parking lot on Monday amid a police operation in the area. His death, the first student death linked with the pro-democracy demonstrations, sparked vigils and fresh protests in Hong Kong. The financial hub is reeling from the impact of the five-month-long protests, police crackdowns and violent clashes between police and protesters. The protest movement emerged out of opposition to a now scrapped extradition bill with China but has morphed into a broader campaign for democratic and police reform in the city.
