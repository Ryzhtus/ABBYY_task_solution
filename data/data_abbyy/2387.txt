Westlife are heading out on tour for 2020 - and tickets to UK shows go on sale today.
Nicky Byrne, Shane Filan, Mark Feehily and Kian Egan will perform at key cities across the country next June as part of their ‘Stadiums in the Summer’ show dates kicking off next June.
Fans of the 90's boyband will get to enjoy classic pop hits including 'Swear It Again' and ‘Flying Without Wings’ as well as new songs from their forthcoming new album ‘Spectrum’ which is released on 15 November.
Tickets go on general sale at 9am today (November 8) through Ticketmaster , following a pre-sale which took place earlier this week, giving fans who had already pre-ordered the album early access.
A source close to the Irish boyband revealed to the Mirror that the boys were planning a huge follow up tour off the back of their sell out Twenty Two shows earlier this year.
At the time the source close to the Irish boyband told us: "Westlife’s comeback tour has been a remarkable success and interest in their new music has been better than the band ever imagined, so plans are well underway for what comes after the album release in November.
"There will also be even more new music with Ed Sheeran . Westlife are popular again. The Twenty Tour sold 700,000 tickets. There is a lot more to come from them, they’re in it for the longterm now."
