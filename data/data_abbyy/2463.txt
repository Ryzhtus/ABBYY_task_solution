There is officially an adidas sneaker for every budget. Just months after launching US$0.99 AriZona Iced Tea-inspired footwear, the German sportswear giant has confirmed that it is working with Prada for a deluxe silhouette. Taking to social media, both Prada and adidas Originals shared a clean image of two adidas shoe boxes fitted in a Prada paper bag. Details are scarce, but leaks shared by Sneaker News point at the sneaker being named the adidas Prada Sailing and bearing a color scheme of “Core White/Metallic Silver/Red.” Its release date is still unknown.
