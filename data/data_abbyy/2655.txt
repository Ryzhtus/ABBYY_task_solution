Kim Kardashian has teamed up with her sisters, Kourtney and Khloe, for her latest KKW Fragrance line. The trio has unveiled the Diamond Collection, which comes in three different fragrances each uniquely fitted to the sisters. The Diamond fragrance belongs to Kim, while the Pink Diamond and Yellow Diamond is for Khloé and Kourtney respectively. The fragrances are presented in a luxurious jewel-shaped bottle, unveiled in a series of posts on the KKW Fragrance account. This includes their photoshoot images, where the three sisters are seen wearing blown-out big curls and skintight bodysuits in three shades. Kourtney wore a yellow-hued costume, in accordance to her fragrance name, while Khloé donned a pastel pink suit. Kim is seen dressed in a complete white turtleneck suit. Kim’s Diamond fragrance is described as a combination of “ylang-ylang and exotic sampaguita bloom,” while Khloé’s Pink Diamond fragrance embodies “notes of italian bergamot and sun-drenched driftwood.” Kourtney’s Yellow fragrance emanates a refreshing floral scent with “sugar-coated ginger.” The Instagram account has treated fans to a lineup of promotional images and videos of the sisters as well as the fragrances. The scents will be sold at US$40 each and US$110 as a bundle on the KKW Fragrance website. Check out some pictures from the refreshing campaign below. Advertisement Advertisement
