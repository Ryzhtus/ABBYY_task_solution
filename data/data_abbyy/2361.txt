It’s a surprise that the beloved Scandinavian homeware giant hasn’t released a festive advertising campaign in all its 70-plus years, but IKEA has finally debuted one in 2019. The company has unveiled its first-ever Christmas commercial titled Silence the Critics, which encourages shoppers to overcome “home shame” and open up their dwellings to visitors this festive season. Produced by creative company Mother London, the advert sees a couple with their child in a home filled with backdated ornaments and homeware. The aged decorations around the house then come to life, taunting the family for leaving its living space in a horrendous state. The various ornaments call out the furnishing and lack of space in the house through an original grime track voiced by MC D Double E. Towards the end, a brutally honest plastic T-Rex gives it to the family straight by saying, “This is very, very, very, very unacceptable,” urging them to spruce up their living space.

IKEA’s UK and Ireland marketing manager, Sarah Green, explains that the advert sheds light on “the phenomenon of ‘home shame,’” and spurs homeowners to “overcome the negative voices in their head” that call upon them to restrict them homes from visitors during the joyous season.
