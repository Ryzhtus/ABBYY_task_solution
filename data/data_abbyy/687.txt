SIOUX FALLS, S.D. (AP) - Several hundred people gathered for a candlelight vigil in Sioux Falls to mourn the death of a high school freshman killed in an interstate crash and pray for the recovery of a second teen who was seriously injured.
High school students, adults and younger children gathered in freezing temperatures on a football field outside the Sanford Pentagon arena Thursday night to remember 15-year-old Barry Grieve, who died in a rollover crash on Interstate 229 Tuesday night.
Another freshman at Lincoln High School, 16-year-old Mhiretab Tsegaye, is hospitalized with life-threatening injuries.
The Argus Leader reports Lincoln teacher Xavier Pastrano it’s something that they won’t get over, but it’s something that will take time to get through.
