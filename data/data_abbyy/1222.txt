In its mission and structure, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) is an intrinsically international organization: it employs 18,000 people in more than 90 countries in an effort to protect and assist victims of war and internal violence. As Director General of the ICRC, Yves Daccord oversees the aid organization’s active protection and assistance assignments, and its diplomatic defense of international humanitarian law and standards.The Swiss leader’s upbringing provides him with pertinent insight into the ICRC’s transnational project. Born in the German-speaking part of the country but educated in French, Daccord is intimately familiar with the skills required to bridge the gap between different cultures.
“The founder of the ICRC, Henry Dunant understood the action that was needed, which was to help the wounded and other victims of war,” he said. “But he also understood quickly that you needed a common grammar between states for them to respect each other when it comes to war. And that shared understanding is the Geneva Conventions.”
After 27 years working at the ICRC, nine of which he has spent as Director General, Daccord is deeply familiar with the issues and regions that the organization is involved with. This expertise, while necessary, also constitutes one of the most significant challenges in his career in humanitarian aid. While work on the ground comes with its own challenges, Daccord’s bird’s-eye view of crises can sometimes provide him with a bleak outlook on a situation’s progress, or lack thereof.
“What can be hard for someone in my position is when you know a region well and you return there after 5 years and things have worsened, or not improved as you had hoped,” Daccord said. “When you are in an emergency situation, the going is tough, but your mission is clear. It’s much more distressing when that emergency lasts as we’ve seen in South Sudan, Syria, Ukraine, Myanmar, or Afghanistan.”
Daccord’s comprehensive approach to crisis resolution stands in stark opposition to that which he has observed on the ground. While he is concerned with contextualizing conflicts within a global history, local communities tend to advocate for self-sufficiency.
“Today when our team arrives in a city in Syria that has been besieged for months and sits down with local people to discuss their needs, most of the time their first priority is to get Wi-Fi,” he shared. “People today are remarkably savvy in the ways that they inform themselves and they connect to find solutions.”
The ICRC thrives by combining both these macro and micro perspectives on crisis management. For Daccord, an intersectional mode of operation can be beneficial in any sector as it allows organizations to move beyond the binary limitations of a top-down or bottom-up design.
“I think that what’s interesting is to balance the radically new things coming from the bottom, which could be your clients and the people you work with, and at the same time think about how you will negotiate with bigger actors and stakeholders, in our case nations and how they frame ethics and other critical questions,” he reasoned.
The organizational structure of the ICRC encourages constant collaboration between leaders and communities. With missions across the world along with 191 national societies and an International Federation, all under the umbrella of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, the institution prefers to prioritize a global vision for peace over a given leader’s agenda.
“In a way that is very different from any other organization, we have decided to be leaderless,” Daccord reflected. “We do not to have an ambassador. We have very good leaders, but we don’t want to have a single leader incarnate all of that the Red Cross represents. That is what allows our organization to be truly universal.”
A flexible leadership that accounts for diverse voices is essential to the ICRC’s culture. Over the course of his career, Daccord has recognized a need for management that moves beyond the lessons of a traditional education. The necessity to adapt his leadership has become even more pronounced as millennials have integrated into the workforce, expecting a vision that accommodates today’s fast-paced world.
“What people want and need is a recognition that the leaders of today and tomorrow will offer something new, instead of repeating what past leaders have done,” he said. “MBA studies emphasize how to emulate great leaders, but that doesn’t work anymore. Global leaders like myself are having to let go and recognize the value of different or emerging practices. You have to be flexible and agile and constantly reflect on the relevance of your management style.”
The global issues that the ICRC tackles lend themselves particularly well to Daccord’s vision of leadership as a role and way of being that are constantly in flux. As he and his organization continue to shape themselves according to the changing needs of the humanitarian landscape, Daccord is confident that the ICRC has a productive future to look forward to.
“The mission and purpose stay the same, but you constantly have to revisit it with a fresh pair of eyes depending on the context,” Daccord said. “That’s part of what makes me optimistic about the organization and its future: when human beings are able to effectively mobilize solidarity and intelligence, it can be very powerful.”
