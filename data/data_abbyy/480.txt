Troye Sivan might be one of our horniest pop stars.
His music is one long collection of trembling, heartfelt paeans to the flesh — to the things that the body is capable of. ‘Bloom’ is the obvious example, of course, but even something like the sultry ‘My My My!’ has an ecstatic rhythm all of its own.
Now, that latter song has been made even lustier thanks to the work of Brisbane-based musician Wafia.
The rising pop master took on the song as part of triple j’s Like A Version, as well as a performance of her own ‘Flowers & Superpowers’. Her cover hews close to the basics, putting that already classic melody at the very forefront, and keeping the instrumentation thrillingly simple.
Wafia is no stranger to Like A Version, of course. Previously, she lent her vocals to Ta-Ku’s mournful cover of the R&B classic ‘Leave’, by JoJo, and she even had her own song ‘Bodies’ covered by The Herd. But this new track blows those others out of the water, standing as a highpoint in the art of making sexy songs even sexier. Troye Sivan must be extremely proud.
