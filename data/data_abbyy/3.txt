Victoria’s Secret Angel Candice Swanepoel has turned up the heat by wearing a tiny leopard-print bikini from her swimwear collection, Tropic of C. The halter-top swimsuit features tiny triangle-shaped cups, with a tortoise ring in the middle connecting the two cups. The bottoms are high-cut, matching the overall design. In the photo, Swanepoel stares fiercely and is covered in a green and yellow plaid shawl. The bikini is part of the Tropic of C swimwear collection, and Swanepoel describes in her caption that it is the “new #lira” in “mini #mamaafrica print.” Advertisement Advertisement Tropic of C is her own collection, and is largely influenced by nature. The picture has expectedly gotten many excited compliments from fans, with many calling it “perfection” and adoringly asking if she is even human.
