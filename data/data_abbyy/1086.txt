MP wants repair work on damaged stretch to be complete within 2 mnths Bengaluru South MP Tejasvi Surya inspected the Bannerghatta Road and directed officials to take up the pending work at the earliest. Following a series of reports in BM about the poor condition of Bannerghatta Road, the MP visited the area along with officials on Thursday. "I really thank Mirror for highlighting the plight and I have been seriously following the reports. We shall soon ensure that some action is taken to solve the issue," he said. Earlier, Tejasvi inspected a 3-km stretch between Vega City Mall and Swagat Junction. The residents complained about the culverts being built unscientifically and work on it not being complete. Tejasvi asked Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara P alike Commissioner Anil Kumar to transfer errant officials immediately. "The condition of the footpath in front of the IIM-B campus is really bad. The slabs are broken and garbage is being dumped in the drain. Right at the entrance of the institution, there is an open drain and sewage water is flowing into it," he said. Tejasvi noted that a number of hospitals are located on Bannerghatta Road and the stench from the area is affecting the patients. Meanwhile, the MP also directed officials from BMRCL, BWSSB and BBMP to come up with a plan in 10 days to fix the damaged stretch on the Bannerghatta Road and repair it within two months.
