Royal Enfield volumes declined by 21 percent YoY to 1.67 lakh units in Q2FY20 due to weak demand and high ownership cost, while VECV's volume fell 39 percent YoY.
However, the net realisation is likely to improve by around 12 percent YoY due to ABS-related price increase and mix improvement.
At the operating level, earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) may fall around 25-30 percent YoY and there could be a steep margin contraction.
Utility vehicle and tractor-maker Mahindra and Mahindra is likely to report a double-digit decline in the September quarter.

Motilal Oswal, which expects profit to decline 12.4 percent, said e company's realisation is expected to improve 3.7 percent YoY (down 1 percent QoQ), as impact of price increase was partly offset by the product mix.
