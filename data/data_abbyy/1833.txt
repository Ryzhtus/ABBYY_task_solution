The following article contains SPOILERS from the November 8, 2019 tapings of WWE Raw in Manchester, England. With WWE concluding its marathon tapings of Raw and Friday Night SmackDown in Manchester, England, fans are already beginning to weigh in on what is already being called one of the worst segments of 2019, if not the worst.
Under the tutelage of Paul Heyman, who jarringly vacillates between silky-smooth pro wrestling genius and creepy old man, WWE Raw has taken liberties with salacious, sexually charged storylines. Before Mike Kanellis decided he had enough, he was on the wrong end of a deliberately emasculating pregnancy storyline opposite real-life wife Maria Kanellis.
Now, WWE appears to have absorbed that now-defunct pregnancy angle into yet another storyline (for now) lover’s quarrel between real-life spouses.
During the Raw tapings, Lana—amid intense heckling and boos—admitted to being seven weeks pregnant with Rusev’s baby. Lana also discussed her sex life with Bobby Lashley in a segment where Rusev went on to admit that he is indeed a sex addict.
With fans and viewers clearly not on board with a storyline that bombed as a main even segment two weeks ago, WWE has decided to double down by having the babyface cop to a sex addiction while fathering the baby of a cartoonishly adulterous wife.
I’ll let Twitter take it from here.
WWE Raw has drawn its third and fourth-lowest non-holiday viewership totals over the past two weeks. Firmly cemented as the B-show, WWE can only hope that all the negative buzz sure to be generated from this angle will somehow lead to more viewers tuning in because they simply cannot miss a trainwreck.
