Michelle Obama on Thursday unveiled her star-studded “voting squad” as her nationwide get-out-the-vote effort ahead of the 2020 election.
The former first lady posted a video from her When We All Vote campaign that features A-list celebrities such as Tom Hanks, Lin-Manuel Miranda and Selena Gomez.
“Last year, we went big,” Mrs. Obama says in the video. “Millions of new voters made their voices heard for the first time. Now, the stakes are even higher.
“That’s why I’ve been reaching out to some friends to expand my voting squad for the year ahead,” she says in the video.
Mrs. Obama serves as a co-chair on When We All Vote along with Mr. Hanks, Mr. Miranda and Ms. Gomez. Other celebrities who serve as co-chairs include Liza Koshy, Shonda Rhimes, Megan Rapinoe, Tracee Ellis Ross, Kerry Washington, Faith Hill, Rita Wilson and Chris Paul.
“It all starts with you,” the celebrities say in the video. “You’re the only person that can have that conversation with your family and your friends and your girlfriends and even with your community to get them registered and ready to vote. … When we all vote, we can change the world.”
Mr. Hanks said, ”Registering new voters is an act of hope and taking part in the American idea,” the Associated Press reported. He added that voting guarantees the blessings of ”liberty for the grandkids.”
