MILAN (AP) - Top-seeded Alex de Minaur beat Frances Tiafoe at the Next Gen Finals on Friday to reach his second successive final in Milan.
The Australian overcame second-seeded Tiafoe 4-2, 4-1, 0-4, 4-2 in the first semifinal of the season-ending tournament for top under-21 players.
The 20-year-old De Minaur dominated the match but had to recover from losing the third set. He sealed the victory on his first match point when his American opponent hit a forehand into the net.
Italian wild card Jannik Sinner plays Miomir Kecmanovic of Serbia in the other semifinal at the event, which features a unique format where each set is first to four games.
