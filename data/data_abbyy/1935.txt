DENTON, Texas (AP) - At least three people were killed and three others injured in the collision and explosion of two semitrailers and three passenger vehicles on Interstate 35W in North Texas, north of Fort Worth.
The crash happened just before 1:30 p.m. Friday near the University of North Texas campus in Denton, about 55 miles north of Fort Worth. One of the semis was loaded with tanks of propane, some of which exploded on impact.
Denton Fire-Rescue spokesman Jason Eddington said the three people killed were dead at the scene, while the three others were taken to a hospital for treatment of minor injuries.
Denton police said the northbound lanes of the interstate were to be closed between Farm-to-Market Road 2449 and Interstate 35E until Saturday while cleanup work is underway.
