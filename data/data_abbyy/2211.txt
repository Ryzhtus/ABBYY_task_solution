You’ve probably heard a ton of talk about Black Friday over the past few days, especially if you’ve been keeping an eye out for great deals on tech products online. But what is Black Friday? Well, it’s one of the biggest shopping events of the year. Black Friday is the day after Thanksgiving, and it has long been highlighted by retailers as the time to offer some of the biggest discounts on their latest and greatest products. Traditionally, that has led to huge groups of people, and even stampedes, at many of the top retail locations around the country, but thanks to the rise of online retail, these days you don’t necessarily have to brave the crowds to get great deals.
The exact history of Black Friday is a little murky, but some suggest that the term came about because many retailers would operate at a financial loss, or “in the red,” up until the start of the holiday shopping season, when they would return to profitability, or being “in the black.”
Of course, the history is one thing—but what you’ll get from Black Friday 2019 is something else entirely.
So what exactly should you expect from Black Friday deals? Well, there will likely be deals on pretty much everything. Perhaps the biggest deals will be on tech products. Black Friday is known for massive deals on things like TVs, laptops and even smartphones. You’ll also be able to get deals on tablets, iPads and so on.
You’ll be able to find some great deals on non-tech products too. There will be massive deals on furniture, clothing and more. In other words, no matter what you’re in the market for, there should be a great deal for you.
Some deals are live right now. What that means is that you could get an amazing discount on something right away, then sit back and relax on Black Friday itself.
