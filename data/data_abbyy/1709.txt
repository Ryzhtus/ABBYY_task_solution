An aide to Vice President Mike Pence has arrived on Capitol Hill to testify behind closed doors in the Democrats' impeachment investigation.

Democrats booked Bolton after other witnesses, including former White House aide Fiona Hill, testified about Bolton's concerns over the administration's Ukraine policy.

President Donald Trump is denying he wanted Attorney General William Barr to hold a news conference to declare that Trump broke no laws when he pressed Ukraine's president to investigate Democrats.
Trump tweets that the story first reported by The Washington Post is "just another FAKE NEWS story with anonymous sources that don't exist."
The Post says Barr rebuffed the request, which came around the time the White House released a rough transcript of the call.

Democrats are set to begin public impeachment hearings next week after a series of closed-door sessions with current and former government officials.
The goal is to present a convincing narrative of presidential misconduct by Donald Trump.
First to testify will be William Taylor, the current top diplomat in Ukraine. He's relayed in private his understanding that there was a quid pro quo, with Trump holding up military aid to Ukraine as the U.S. ally faced threats from neighboring Russia.
That aid is at the heart of the impeachment inquiry. The assistance is alleged to have been held hostage until Ukraine agreed to investigate Trump political foe Joe Biden as well as the idea that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 U.S. election. The claim is at odds with U.S. intelligence findings.
