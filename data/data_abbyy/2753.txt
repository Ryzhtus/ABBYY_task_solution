FORT COLLINS, Colo. (AP) - The family of 6-year-old Colorado boy who died after being hit in a crosswalk outside his school is inviting the public to his funeral.
A service will be held for Vale Wolkow at First Presbyterian Church in Fort Collins at 11 a.m. Saturday.
The Coloradoan newspaper reports that a livestream will be available in the church’s fellowship hall to accommodate those who can’t fit inside the church.
The kindergartner died Tuesday after he was hit by an SUV driven by a 23-year-old man. Police say the driver had stopped at a four-way stop and then drove forward, hitting the boy.
Police are still investigating but don’t believe that speed, alcohol or drugs were a contributing factor.
