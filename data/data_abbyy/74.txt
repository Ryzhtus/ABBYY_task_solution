Kanye West is taking a step towards sustainability through the latest innovation of Yeezy footwear made out of algae. The rapper had previously suggested creating biodegradable shoes, and he finally introduced the first design to help fulfill his promise during Fast Company’s Innovation Festival. West, along with Yeezy head designer Steven Smith, showcased the Crocs-like prototype partially made from algae.

West envisions to “bring manufacturing jobs back to America,” and announced that the entire production will take place at a large 4,000-acre headquarters in Wyoming with the company’s own hydroponic farm to run the whole “seed-to-sole” process. Yeezy officially announced on Twitter that the algae shoe will be named Yeezy Foam Runner, adding that it will be available for US$75 in 2020.
