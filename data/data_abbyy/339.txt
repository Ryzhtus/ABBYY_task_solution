Adobe software users were absolutely captivated when Apple and Adobe first showed off a “full” Photoshop for iPad using a 3GB file with 157 layers sans any lagging. Understandably, creative professionals were looking forward to the app’s launch, but when it finally arrived this week, they were thoroughly disappointed.
Users have described the tool as “premature,” and lamented that it might as well have been named “Photoshop Express” even though Adobe had touted it as a “full Photoshop.” “You released another half-baked program, gimped out without all the features of the desktop, and you want us to pay a subscription fee?” one reviewer wrote. “I want whatever you’re all smoking, because apparently it’s good stuff.” Addressing the criticism on Twitter, Adobe’s Chief Product Officer Scott Belsky justified the program in spite of its poor ratings, defending that it was expected for a longtime favorite like Photoshop to be criticized when ported over to an unfamiliar platform for the first time.

“We didn’t do a good enough job distinguishing between ‘real’... and ‘full,’” he said. A “full” Photoshop would mean a software with every feature available on the desktop version from day one, while a “real” Photoshop meant the iPad app would contain Photoshop’s original codebase and true PSD support. Nevertheless, a “full” Photoshop should be the team’s goal for the app, as Belsky confirmed that an “amazing roadmap of features” have been planned for the iPad version. This week, Adobe’s product team also had to explain why its icons are so “inconsistent,” but its rationale means little to users.
