All good things must come to an end, and sometimes those good things must come to an end twice. Fox announced today that it will not renew its Beverly Hills, 90210 revival, BH90210, for a second season. Close up the Peach Pit. All you rich people, go back to your rich lives. It’s time to finally hang it up for good. Vulture’s review of BH described it by saying, “Unlike the Aaron Spelling original, BH90210 is meta, knowing, and interested in what fame, or post-fame, looks like at middle age. But it’s also the same in that it’s soapy and silly and you can’t stop watching it even though your brain keeps firing neurons screaming that you should know better.” Thanks for the memories new and old, West BH High grads!
