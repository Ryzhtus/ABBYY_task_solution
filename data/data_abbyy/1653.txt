The city police have zeroed in on three notorious drug peddlers from Odisha and Andhra Pradesh and seized 20 kg of ganja from them. The men used to pose as hawkers and hang around railways stations at Carmelaram and Hosur to find their customers. Police also posed in the spots as hawkers for several days before they got leads on the accused. The police had credible information that the accused would come by trains to the railway stations and stand around posing as hawkers. They have been at this for the last one month but on Thursday they were halted in their criminal tracks. The arrested are Shiva Kumar alias Yerla Shiva Kumar, 34, of Ananthapur in Andhra Pradesh, Rathankar Sahoo, 41, and Pankaj Digal, 45, both from Odisha. “The three claim they were getting the ganja from Odisha and Andhra Pradesh and used to transport it in trains. They did not have mobile phone contacts and would sell the ganja to their clients through their network. They would bring the drugs wrapped in chocolate boxes. Efforts were being made to arrest them for the last few days. It was a tedious task to arrest them and the police were stationed at selected spots where the accused would sell the drugs. Police also posed as hawkers to keep an eye on the accused. A few drug addicts also approached police thinking they were drug peddlers and asked for ganja from them. The police managed to speak to these addicts and got enough information to track down the three accused,” said an officer.
