While the white bridal lehenga has been in vogue, there's no denying that the colour red has its own charm. The colour red is known to be one of the auspicious shades for Indian weddings and white colour is known for purity and innocence.
In the last few years, we have seen almost every shade of bridal lehengas, but what recently caught our attention was this white and red lehenga. Bride Misha wore this gorgeous Sabyasachi creation for her wedding in Morocco and looked gorgeous as ever!
The lehenga is white in colour, which features a bright red coloured border with golden embroidery. It was styled with a red coloured blouse, featuring Sabya's signature embroidery work.
She styled it with two dupattas, a white one over her shoulders and a red one as a head veil. Her look was accessorised with an elaborate choker neckpiece, jhumka earrings and a maang-tikka.
What do you think of this stunning colour combination? Let us know in the comment section below.
