West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee onÂ November 8 said the Centre's move to demonetise high- value currency notes on this day in 2016 was a futile exercise which had a negative impact on the country's economy.
Banerjee, on the third anniversary of note ban, asserted that she knew from the very beginning that the decision would ruin millions of lives.
"Today is the third anniversary of #DeMonetisationDisaster. Within minutes of announcement, I had said that it will ruin the economy and the lives of millions. Renowned economists, common people & all experts now agree. Figures from RBI have also shown it was a futile exercise," the chief minister tweeted.

"Economic disaster started on that day and look where it has reached now. Banks stressed, economy in a complete slump. All affected. From farmers to the young generation to workers to traders, housewives... everyone is affected," she added.
Banerjee, during her campaign for the Lok Sabha elections, earlier this year, had promised to conduct an investigation into the demonetisation drive.
On the first anniversary of note ban, she had turned her Twitter display picture black in protest.
