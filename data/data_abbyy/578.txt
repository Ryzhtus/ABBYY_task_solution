Topline: Facebook said Friday it’s deleting mentions of the alleged whistleblower’s name for violating the social network’s “coordinating harm policy,” following a Thursday report from Harvard University that says the platform’s users can still easily share fake news.
Crucial quote: "All of this work is about enforcing our existing policies, not broadening our definition of what is dangerous. If we do this well, we should be able to stop a lot of harm while fighting back against putting additional restrictions on speech,” said Zuckerberg during his Georgetown speech.
Key background: Donald Trump Jr. got into hot water Wednesday for outing the alleged whistleblower by tweeting a link containing their name. Conservative and right-wing media have been actively working to spread that person’s name, but major news outlets have declined to print it. Federal law gives whistleblowers protection from criminal prosecution and workplace retaliation. But President Trump has repeatedly called for the person’s identity to be released. The lawyers representing the whistleblower sent a cease-and-desist letter to Trump Friday, asking for him to stop demanding the person’s identity be made public. He responded by saying the lawyers should be sued “maybe for treason.”
News peg: House Democrats launched Trump’s impeachment inquiry September 24. It stemmed from the whistleblower’s report that alleged Trump sought help from Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden. The report, along with released partial transcripts of a July phone call between Trump and Zelensky, became the basis of the Democrats’ inquiry.
What to watch for: If conservatives view Facebook’s decision to delete the alleged whistleblower’s name as an act of suppression. They have repeatedly claimed their viewpoints are silenced on social media.
