Samsung’s Galaxy S10 is a solid smartphone which is now available at ridiculously low prices. But with the Galaxy S11, we now know Samsung is aiming much higher.

Spotted by the ever-alert GalaxyClub.nl, Safety Korea’s website (think FFC for Samsung’s home country of South Korea) has just publicly certified the battery for Samsung’s entry-level Galaxy S11e and it shows just how big the company is thinking.
Codenamed EB-BG980ABY and also photographed on the site (image below), its smartphone connection is tied to the ‘G980’ part of its name. As noted by SamMobile, Samsung always ties the two together so, for example, G970 batteries were in the SM-G97xx Galaxy S10 line-up and G960 batteries were in SM-G96xx Galaxy S9 models. The Galaxy S11 series is the SM-G98xx range.
And here’s where it gets interesting. While the capacity is blurred, the rated battery capacity of 14.36W can be seen and the typical smartphone operation of 3.85 volts means we’re looking at a circa 3,800 mAh battery. That’s 700 mAh larger than the Galaxy S10e which was already a phone with good battery life.

With the Galaxy S10 and Galaxy S10+ rated at 3400 mAh and 4100 mAh respectively, this suggests circa 4,000 mAh and 5,000 mAh batteries for the Galaxy S11 and Galaxy S11+. Though perhaps such a jump should not be surprising given the upcoming Galaxy S10 Lite has a staggering battery increase.
Furthermore, the motivations are clear. Apple’s iPhone 11 range has massively increased battery life, while Samsung is looking to adopt 5G across the range and 5G is power-hungry. It’s also not the headline update getting added to the Galaxy S11 lineup with a groundbreaking camera, upgraded design, major performance increases, next-gen memory, a supersized fingerprint sensor and AI-focused image processing all being added.
Samsung is also working on revolutionary new charging tech, though I don’t expect it to arrive in time for the Galaxy S11 lineup. That said, Samsung clearly means business in 2020. Why? Because it will also be a revolutionary year for the iPhone.
