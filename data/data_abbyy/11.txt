A rather odd incident happened early Thursday morning, when people all over the United States and Canada began receiving random text messages from people they knew. It was difficult to understand many of those texts as there was no context, and even seemed to be sent from months before, as reported by Gizmodo. Twitter users quickly shared their experiences online, and their situations seemed to corroborate with each other’s. They all received texts from either friends or family members during late hours, and the messages appeared to be sent either on Valentine’s Day or sometime in February. For instance, one Twitter user shared that a close friend who had been going through some challenges in life suddenly sent a vague text at 1am, reading, “Come get me!” Subsequent responses were left unanswered, so emergency services were called and the police even went to the friend’s house. The friend then confirmed that she did not send the text. Other accounts included an announcement from a teacher that school had been canceled, as well as a dismal note from an ex who was deliberating on taking her life. Gizmodo contacted several major cellular carriers in the US to get to the bottom of the issue. A spokesperson from Sprint gave a detailed explanation, stating that the texts were messages that were “successfully sent” awhile back. Due to a “maintenance update” that affected multiple carriers, some customers had the older texts sent to their phones.

Either way, one can take comfort in the likelihood that the texts were not creepily made up by unknown parties.
