Volkswagen has sold out of the compact Caddy Beach camper introduced last year, and the model won't be renewed for 2020.
Just 120 examples of the camper van made it to Australia, priced from $46,990 drive-away, featuring a fold-out bed, walk-through tent, two folding camp chairs, blockout curtains, and plenty of interior storage for weekends away.
When not on campsite duty, the Caddy Beach converts into a five-seat people carrier.
Volkswagen Australia says the decision to end the camper's run is "a rationalisation of the range".
"I don’t think anyone could accuse the Beach of being anything other than a niche model," a spokesperson told CarAdvice.
"We brought in a few examples of it in the last model year, but it’s had its run."
Moving forward, Volkswagen Australia will focus on the T6.1 California camper revealed in August. As with the wider Multivan and Caravelle range, the updated California gets a more modern look on the outside, more technology on the inside, and a revised range of front- and all-wheel drive powertrains.
Although the California hasn't been confirmed for Australia, local Volkswagen representatives have made it clear the company wants it.
"We still see the California as being a strong opportunity, which is why we’re working hard on introducing it as part of the T6.1 rollout," the Volkswagen Australia spokesperson said.
