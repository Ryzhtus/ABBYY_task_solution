Marks and Spencer have unveiled their latest Christmas offering.
The new ad for the festive season features classic Christmas settings with a twist.
House of Pain's Jump Around blares over the ad, with everyone who dons an M&S piece of clothing busting out some moves.
M&S, which is the UK's biggest knitwear retailer, invites us to "Go Jumpers" in a light-hearted update for the chain.
It shows off 50 jumpers from the range, with M&S expecting to flog more than a whopping five million jumpers over the festive season.
Clothing & Home Marketing Director at M&S Nathan Ansell is confident the ad will show shoppers that the chain's made some major shakeups since last holiday season.
"This year our Christmas campaign really brings the changes we're making at M&S in clothing to life," Nathan said, "It's all about great style and great value for the whole family.
"We're backing with confidence our biggest commercial category for Christmas and importantly having some fun with out customers and colleagues.
"We can't wait to see the nation Go Jumpers for Christmas."
Recent changes have also seen M&S adopt a more family-based approach -this has included a collaboration with Disney ahead of the release of its film Frozen 2, which is sure to be a massive hit.
Its Christmas gift shops have also launched earlier than ever before thanks to shopper demand.
