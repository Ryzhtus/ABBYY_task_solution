Start with the physical foundations: Rest your brain with 7-9 hours sleep per night. Hydrate your neurons with half a liter of water for every 30lb of body weight. Oxygenate your brain by walking 5000-10,000 steps per day and doing 150 minutes of aerobic exercise per week. Meditate for 20 minutes a day. Take the supplements that suit your needs. Eat as much oily fish, eggs, nuts and seeds, green leafy vegetables, avocado, olives and coconut oil as you can. Drink four cups of green tea per week.
Then, by training your brain to have an abundant outlook on life (immediately replacing any negative thoughts with a positive mantra), building your mental resilience (through gratitude lists and the physical factors that keep your brain in peak condition like sleep, fuel, exercise and mindfulness) you build the knowledge that you have the tools within yourself to deal with anything that life throws at you. The physical factors are foundational to avoiding burnout as we are not machines with infinite physical resources. The belief that we live in an abundant world where there is enough out there for everyone negates the despair, hopelessness and loss of motivation that can lead to burnout. Evolving gratitude lists from the ‘things’ we have, to the capabilities and potential that we have is a game changer in terms of the resilience to deal with things we didn’t think we could.
