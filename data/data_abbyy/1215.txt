“LIC seems to be becoming aggressive with the recent launch of new products in protection (Jeevan Amar at competitive rates), limited pay endowment par policy (Jeevan Labh offered at attractive IRRs) and the possible launch of new ULIP products (communicated in a recent media interview) and thus increasing competitive intensity,” said the Emkay report.
At the end of October 2019, LIC held a market share of 70.9 percent while private insurers held 29.1 percent based on the new premium collection.Get access to India's fastest growing financial subscriptions service Moneycontrol Pro for as little as Rs 599 for first year.
