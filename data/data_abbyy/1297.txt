A 70-year-old lady who had lost her gold chain worth Rs 80,000 after a man lured her about six months ago, had decided not to file a complaint as the old couple were not in the stage to approach the police. Luck turned after she identified the man’s face in a media report about him being arrested by the police recently. She recalled the man’s face and filed a complaint with the Yeshwantpur police and is in the process of receiving her gold chain. She had lost all hope of receiving the chain back. The accused, Manjesh was arrested by the Bagalagunte police on October 21, for targeting and diverting the lone women’s attention and stealing their gold ornaments. With Manjesh’s arrest, the police had cracked 14 cases and recovered about Rs 30 lakh worth of gold. The news was reported by all the media houses and to the old lady’s luck, she came across the news and managed identified him. The victim, Sita Ramachandra, resides in Yeshwantpur with her husband and son. On April 20, Sita was home alone while her son had gone out of station and her husband had left for work. While she was sitting outside the house, Manjesh approached her and asked her if she was getting money, as the government was giving money to senior citizens. He convinced her that he would take her to the BBMP office and get the card done so that she could start getting money on a monthly basis. Thinking that the money would help them for their medicines, she agreed to go with him. He took her to some office nearby and asked her to sit at the entrance. He told her that the officers wouldn’t agree to give the money if they see the gold ornaments on her and asked her to remove them. On the pretext of keeping the gold safe with him, he took it from her. She waited for a couple of hours only to realise that she was conned. When she narrated the incident to her husband, he advised her to let it go as they don’t know his name or where he stays. She told the police that due to their age, she along with her husband decided to leave the matter and not file a complaint with the police. Sita went through the reports and told her son about it. She along with her son, filed a complaint on Friday.
