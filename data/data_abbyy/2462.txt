Stress Level Zero’s physics-based VR shooter Boneworks has finally gotten a release date in a lengthy new trailer.
Launching on December 10 for Vive, Index, Rift and Windows Mixed Reality, Boneworks features complex physics and grappling simulations to an extent that VR hasn’t quite seen yet. Grabbing enemies’ limbs in different areas, realistic climbing, using environmental objects as makeshift weapons, realistic gun handling (including some neat John Wick-y close-quarters shooting) and physics-based puzzles all feature heavily in the newest trailer, which is a whopping six minutes long.
In a lot of ways, and at the risk of sounding hyperbolic, Boneworks feels like VR’s Half-Life 2 moment. We’ve had physics interactions in games before, with projects like Blade & Sorcery doing it very well. However, they’re all either still in early access, or more limited in scope than Boneworks. It’s similar to how Half-Life 2 is notable for how it integrates dynamic physics across its entire full-length campaign at a time when many other games just weren’t quite there yet.
Another reason Boneworks is noteworthy is its implementation of the Index knuckle controller’s finger tracking. It’s not shown massively in this trailer, although you can see it in action at around the 2:30 mark when the player character wriggles their fingers before picking up a cinder-block. Seeing how finger tracking plays into the game’s physics will be very interesting.
A price for Boneworks has yet to be announced, although with its release being just over a month away, we won’t have long to wait. Until then, the game’s Steam page is now live, letting you wishlist it in advance of launch day.
