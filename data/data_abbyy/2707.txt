BOSTON - The Tobin BridgeÂ has gone to the dogs!
On Thursday afternoon, at around 3:30 p.m., a State Police trooper responded to a call for two dogs running loose on the Tobin Bridge.
Two drivers had pulled over and kept the dogs from being hit by cars until police arrived.
Troopers then safely put the two pups in the back of a cruiser. Chelsea Animal Control officers transported the dogs to an animal hospital.
It is unknown who the dogs belong to and how they ended up on the bridge by themselves.
