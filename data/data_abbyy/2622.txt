Sinha further said multiple other demand indicators like vehicle sales, domestic air passenger traffic, petroleum consumption and rural wages have performed poorly.
Moreover, floods in many states during the monsoon appear to have impacted rural demand which had been already subdued. Globally, concerns on the trade war and protectionist policies are reflected in the indices, he noted.
"The government has taken measures to counter these economic headwinds, but our respondents are not seeing signs of revival as yet. We expect further actions in the coming months," Sinha said.
The report noted that optimism for net profits stood at 59 percent - a decline of 7 percentage points as compared to the September quarter 2019. Optimism for new orders stood at 35 percent - down 22 percentage points as against the previous quarter.
