COLUMBIA, Mo. (AP) - Missouri’s health department wants to ban medical marijuana businesses from paying taxes, fines or fees in cash.
But a hopeful Missouri marijuana producer on Friday told The Associated Press that banning cash payments could shut small businesses out of the industry.
BeLeaf CEO Mitch Meyers says national banks shy away from working with the marijuana industry because selling cannabis is federally banned.
Meyers says it took her years to open a state bank account, and her success was based in part on her other CBD oil business. She says small, rural businesses might not be able to access banking.
The Health and Senior Services Department is accepting public feedback on the proposed emergency rule through Tuesday.
An Associated Press request for comment to the department was not immediately returned Friday.
