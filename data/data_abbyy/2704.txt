The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) continued to build its dollar defenses in October, after a temporary dip in the previous month.
On Thursday, the country’s central monetary authority reported that it was able to raise the country’s gross international reserves (GIR) by $121 million in a month’s time in October, to end the month at $85.7 billion.
The country’s GIR is the level of foreign-exchange holdings the Central Bank has during a given period. The GIR is a crucial component of the economy as it is often used to manage the country’s foreign-exchange rate against excess volatility.  According to the BSP’s statement, the month-on-month increase in the GIR level reflects the national government’s foreign-currency deposits and BSP’s income from its investments abroad.
However, the increase could have been larger if not tempered by payments made by the national government for servicing its foreign-exchange obligations.
At this level, the BSP said the country’s GIR provides an ample external liquidity buffer that is equivalent to 7.5 months’ worth of imports of goods and services and payment of primary income.
It is also equivalent to 5.5 times the country’s short-term external debt based on original maturity and 4.1 times based on residual maturity.
It is also about $11 billion higher than the GIR of the country in the same month last year.
The GIR took a beating toward the end of the year in 2018, plunging to seven-year lows as the BSP battled to smoothen out volatilities in the then-depreciating value of the local currency against the dollar. It also came at a time when sentiment was down due to the accelerating inflation, which also peaked at 6.7 percent during those months. GIR hit its lowest level in 2018 at $74.7 billion in October.
