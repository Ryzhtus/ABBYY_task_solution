LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) - Kentucky says forward EJ Montgomery will miss the No. 2 Wildcats’ game Friday night against Eastern Kentucky with a right ankle injury.

Montgomery is being evaluated daily for the injury. He had four points, two blocks and two rebounds while playing 14 minutes in the win.
Montgomery averaged 4.1 points and 3.8 points per game as a freshman. He started Kentucky’s final 11 contests and grabbed 11 rebounds in the Wildcats’ NCAA Tournament-opening win over Abilene Christian.
