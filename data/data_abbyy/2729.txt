NORTH PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) - Prosecutors say the former superintendent in North Providence has pleaded no contest to embezzlement for misusing a school-issued credit card.
Attorney General Peter Neronha says 49-year-old Bridget Morisseau, formerly of Cumberland, entered the plea Friday in Providence County Superior Court. She was sentenced to three years of probation and ordered to pay nearly $9,500 in restitution within a week.
Neronha says the personal expenditures included payments for airfare, catering, resort accommodations and a hotel stay, and the school department made payments to Morisseau that were outside the scope of her contract.
Morisseau resigned in July 2018 after being accused of misusing district funds. The school committee accepted her resignation and commissioned an audit.
Mayor Charles Lombardi told The Providence Journal the city has taken steps to monitor the school department’s spending.
