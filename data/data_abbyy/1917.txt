Adobe’s seemingly random icon shapes have been bugging creatives for years, and many wonder why the company hasn’t gotten around to unifying the logos despite having updated its software several times. The company explained the differences between its apps designed as squares and those identified with rounded edges in detail back in 2017, but now that it has rolled out Photoshop 2020, it is facing these frustrations again.
Taking to Twitter, Photoshop’s Product Management Director Stephen Nielson summarized why some icons are curved while others are square. “Adobe apps get rounded corners when they become multi-device and cloud-aware,” he explained. “It is not a mistake that Photoshop 2020 suddenly has rounded corners, but [Illustrator] and [InDesign] do not.” He also addressed that Illustrator is still distinguished by a square shape because while its iPad app had just been announced, it isn’t available yet. Creative professionals aren’t totally buying this logic, with Neil A. Evans, Creative Director of Neil Evans Agency, responding, “An icon that has to be explained is rubbish. I don’t care if it’s multi platform [or] if I install it on my other platforms… Make the icons consistent.” Graphic designer Gareth also pointed out that creatives wouldn’t normally care about differentiating cloud-aware software, so the icons might as well share the same shape. Davey Heuser, Product Designer at customer messaging platform Intercom, chimed in, “Is it really not a mistake if people who pay for their Adobe suite complain about their dock icons being inconsistent?” They might be right. If users aren’t familiar or haven’t been on board with the rationale for years, why continue confusing them?
