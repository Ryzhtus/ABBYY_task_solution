Generally, there are few things considered more glamorous than moviemaking and Hollywood, and there are few things considered less glamorous than taxes.However, Forest Road, a start-up that has already successfully funded over $300 million worth of state motion picture tax credits for more than 150 film and TV projects, believes filmmakers should look at how they can both be as alluring as each other.
With the thirst for content unquenched, the quest to find new ways to fund its creation as cost-effectively as possible is fiercer than ever.
Forest Road has come up with a new approach. Essentially, the company lends against tax credits. They’re a full-service provider in the independent film space, with one main goal and that’s to assist filmmakers to compete with major studio films.
The company’s board already boasts former Chief Operating Officer of The Walt Disney Company, Tom Staggs, producer Effie Brown, producer and director Jon Turteltaub, and producer Deborah Oppenheimer among others.
I caught up with Forest Road’s CEO, Zach Tarica, to discuss the model, where it works, where it doesn’t work, and what he considers to be the company’s Achilles heel.
Simon Thompson: What’s the basis of the idea, and where did it come from?
Zach Tarica: Tax credits are an asset. It’s an underlying asset class and people for a very long time, not high net worth individuals or Fortune 500 corporations, individuals like us don’t take advantage of the tax ramifications in ways to reduce our tax liability. So, you and I live in California. We pay the second-highest state and federal taxes in the United States. There are thousands of ways, whether you make $100 million a year or $100,000 a year, to reduce the amount you pay in state and federal tax. I came from an investment bank and a private equity firm, and we were doing all these great things from a tax perspective for massive corporations. I had happened to come across friends that were making a film, and I just saw the synergies. Wearing my private equity hat and saving these dollars from a tax perspective for the biggest corporations in the world, I looked at it from the film side and asked, ‘Why aren’t my friends and why aren’t the small production companies making their $1 million or $5 million film also taking advantage of these?’ It was a case of me seeing if I could take what I’ve learned in one bucket and bring it over to another bucket and merge the two so both can benefit from a positive relationship.
ST: When you tell people about this, how do they react?
ZT: The most common word we hear when we talk to clients is scheme, and we think of schemers, and scheming is not a positive thing. We’re always trying to remind both the client, the borrower, and our investors that we’re a lender. This is not a scheme. This is not a scam or a trick or a loophole. These are programs used by the most successful companies in the world that can afford the best lawyers and accountants to do these programs. What we’re doing is just affording that service to the masses. Tax credits for film have never been more important than they are right now with what’s going on in the content wars and the streaming services that are taking a foothold in the space. Tax credits are 30% of the total budget. If you’re making a documentary, and the budget is $700,000 and you go to your friends and say, ‘I’m going to put in $100,000 of my own money, and you guys put in $600,000 of yours,’ that $700,000 is going to qualify if, and let’s just use round numbers, if $500,000 are qualified expenses. Qualified expenses are expenses that generate jobs, generate tourism, and generate infrastructure growth. If you’re shooting that in Georgia, that 30% credit on a $500,000 spend, that’s another $150,000. So that’s another investor you did not have to call to put money into your film. The opportunity is there, and people have to take advantage of these state programs. It’s also an excellent investment for the state. The state is getting jobs, and they’re getting the infrastructure, and they’re getting people to come into their state lines and spending money in stores, diners, hotels, airfare, and so on. It is a relationship where everyone can benefit because the borrower, the filmmaker, gets that access to capital, and the state is getting the jobs and the money spent in their state lines.
ST: Why isn’t there more of this going on when it comes to funding content?
ZT: All these states are battling each other to get as many production companies as possible to come to their state. If you look at the proposed legislative changes in New Mexico and them carving out Netflix, that is a way in which they can take on more projects. That’s a positive thing. If you look at Louisiana, the fact that they issue an 88 cent buyback and a rebate, that is to lure production companies into coming to their state. Every one of these states is doing something different to pitch you as the filmmaker, and the filmmaker needs to know that there are options. You can make your Vietnam movie in Savannah. You can make your Manhattan movie in Albuquerque. You can do all these different things. It’s just that the filmmaker has to do their homework. Part of what we do as a company is we give that information and advice to Joe Schmo, filmmaker, and say, ‘You don’t have to do this at the Empire State Building, you can do it in upstate New York and Albany and get an increased tax credit.’ There are all these different ways, but it’s really on the filmmaker to borrow or take money and responsibly maximize that value, shoot in the right places and shoot at the right times, and so on.
ST: Is this aimed at people who are starting out or already established people who want to explore a new way of doing things?
ZT: It’s both. I mean, if you look at who are utilizing these programs, it’s everyone from the person making $150,000 horror movie in their backyard in Louisiana to Disney doing Black Panther in Georgia. I mean, it’s one of those things where it’s up to the filmmaker to utilize. Some states have a minimum spend requirement, but for the most part, it’s one of those where you have to know where to shoot, when to shoot and how much capital you can get because this service is for the masses, it’s for everyone.
ST: Forest Road has already funded a slew of projects. What does that look like in reality, and how are you scaling it?
ZT: We’ve done 40 films so far this year alone. We’re a small start-up, and we have more than 400 projects in our pipeline. We care about when you’re shooting, where you’re shooting, how you’re shooting, and maximizing the value of the tax credit. As an example, imagine you were making a movie in Kentucky, and you bought all the things you needed through Walmart. If you were to order it on Walmart.com, none of that would qualify for the tax credit. However, if you went into a Walmart in Lexington and bought it all there, 100% of that would be eligible for the tax credit. It’s these little things that can really make the difference for a film. We’re proud to be part of all of our movies, and what’s notable about us as a business is we’re not filmmakers. We don’t, and I mean this in the nicest way possible way, want to read scripts, we don’t want to see your books, and we don’t care about your cast. I think what’s unique about our list of projects is that we don’t want to be producers. We don’t want credits. We don’t want to be involved in any way other than how can we help from payroll, accounting, cost reports, general ledgers, opinion letters, giving the most value back to the film because these are things that get expensive. As an aspiring filmmaker, you’re going to spend $5,000 on your lawyer, you’re going to spend $10,000 on your accounting and so on, and that quickly becomes $50,000. That’s the difference between one cast member and another, or the difference between potentially two or three extra days of shooting. These add value to the screen, and any way we can prevent leakage from the production company in terms of value, we’re pumped to be a part of.
ST: As a business, you need to make money, so how and where do you make money in the process?
ZT: So, we’re a lender. We give capital to filmmakers. The first place that we make money is on interest income. If we lend you $100, we have a fixed 10% repayment. Straightforward. It’s as easy as that. We give you $100; you give us $110 back. That’s the first way we make money. The second is that we offer services, ancillary services, at an extremely reduced price. Through different companies we work with, we make sure borrowers get the opinion letter from the right place, that the payroll provider is doing the right thing, that everything they’re doing in post-production is in accordance with the film commission’s rules in that state. It’s about everything being done right and the borrower being happy with the outcome of the project.  The third place is brokering tax credits. For example, Georgia has tax credits, and they get issued to Disney at a price, and we then move those to someone with that tax liability. So it’s finding a seller of tax credits and connecting them with the buyer and making a spread. All of those are not mutually exclusive. We’ve had films where we purely provide services. We’ve had films where we purely lend. We’ve had films where we purely broker. We can do all three, and I think when we do all three, the value proposition to the production company is tremendous.
ST: With any business, there is always at least one thing that can put a serious spanner in the works. What is that for Forest Road?
ZT: I think the biggest thing we often see in film is production companies that go into principle without a firm understanding of their financing agreements and their capital. We are a no-fee lender. There are a lot of people that invest in film, and there are a lot of people that charge setup fees, origination fees, legal fees, accounting fees. We don’t do that. So, from our standpoint, the most significant way we get hurt is when the film doesn’t happen. Why is that? Well, it’s because we’re working with you, the filmmaker, and we’re setting up your payroll, and we’re doing your accounting, and we’re working on getting your opinion letter, and when your film doesn’t happen, we are the ones bearing that expense. The most significant risk to us as a business is working with people that don’t truly understand the consequences of not having a complete financing arrangement in place. What we try to do as a lender is to help them make sure they have that taken care of.
