PARIS (AP) - Paris authorities say British singer Pete Doherty has been arrested in Paris for buying cocaine.
The Paris prosecutor’s office said the 40-year old former Libertines and Babyshambles frontman was placed in detention in the night of Thursday-Friday after being stopped by police during a drugs transaction.
The office wouldn’t confirm French media reports that Doherty was carrying 2 grams of cocaine and was arrested in Pigalle, an area known for its late-night bars.
Since rising to fame in the noughties, Doherty, the ex-boyfriend of model Kate Moss, has been repeatedly arrested for drug offenses.
