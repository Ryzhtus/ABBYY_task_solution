As Kanye West appears energized with newfound spiritual beliefs and had even almost quit rapping because of it, he is now thinking of a new name to reflect his new identity. At the Fast Company innovation festival on Thursday, he disclosed he might really change his current name legally to a way longer one. According to Page Six, he related that he was considering the name “Christian Genius Billionaire Kanye West.” Besides this revelation, West also touched on other topics that evoked strong reactions. For instance, he talked about running for president in 2024, which was supposedly meant to be a serious announcement. However, the audience laughed, causing him to stare at them for a prolonged period, as recalled by Inc. staff writer Kevin J. Ryan. Other tweets from Ryan included one of Kanye West listing the four elements as “earth, wind, fire and water” and concluding that “therefore playing with… iPhone” is apparently the same as “playing with dirt.” He did not provide the context from which the topic was brought up.
