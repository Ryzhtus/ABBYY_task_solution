== References ==In November 2018, Google announced its plan to expand its New York City office to a capacity of 12,000 employees.. The same December, it was announced that a $1 billion, 1,700,000-square-foot (160,000 m2) headquarters for Google would be built in Manhattan's Hudson Square neighborhood.
Called Google Hudson Square, the new campus is projected to more than double the number of Google employees working in New York City.By late 2006, Google established a new headquarters for its AdWords division in Ann Arbor, Michigan.. In November 2006, Google opened offices on Carnegie Mellon's campus in Pittsburgh, focusing on shopping-related advertisement coding and smartphone applications and programs.
Other office locations in the U.S.. include Atlanta, Georgia; Austin, Texas; Boulder, Colorado; Cambridge, Massachusetts; San Francisco, California; Seattle, Washington; Kirkland, Washington; Birmingham, Michigan; Reston, Virginia, and Washington, D.C.

It also has product research and development operations in cities around the world, namely Sydney (birthplace location of Google Maps) and London (part of Android development).
In November 2013, Google announced plans for a new London headquarter, a 1 million square foot office able to accommodate 4,500 employees.. Recognized as one of the biggest ever commercial property acquisitions at the time of the deal's announcement in January, Google submitted plans for the new headquarter to the Camden Council in June 2017.
In May 2015, Google announced its intention to create its own campus in Hyderabad, India.. The new campus, reported to be the company's largest outside the United States, will accommodate 13,000 employees.


=== Infrastructure ===

Google data centers are located in North and South America, Asia, and Europe.
There is no official data on the number of servers in Google data centers; however, research and advisory firm Gartner estimated in a July 2016 report that Google at the time had 2.5 million servers.. Traditionally, Google relied on parallel computing on commodity hardware like mainstream x86 computers (similar to home PCs) to keep costs per query low.
In 2005, it started developing its own designs, which were only revealed in 2009.In the late 2010s, Google began to build its own private submarine communications cables.. The first, named Curie, connects California with Chile and was completed in November 15, 2019.
The second fully Google-owned undersea cable, named Dunant, connects the United States with France and is planned to begin operation in 2020.


=== Environment ===
In October 2006, the company announced plans to install thousands of solar panels to provide up to 1.6 megawatts of electricity, enough to satisfy approximately 30% of the campus' energy needs.. The system will be the largest solar power system constructed on a U.S.
corporate campus and one of the largest on any corporate site in the world.. Since 2007, Google has aimed for carbon neutrality in regard to its operations.Google disclosed in September 2011 that it "continuously uses enough electricity to power 200,000 homes", almost 260 million watts or about a quarter of the output of a nuclear power plant.
Total carbon emissions for 2010 were just under 1.5 million metric tons, mostly due to fossil fuels that provide electricity for the data centers.. Google said that 25 percent of its energy was supplied by renewable fuels in 2010.
An average search uses only 0.3 watt-hours of electricity, so all global searches are only 12.5 million watts or 5% of the total electricity consumption by Google.In 2010, Google Energy made its first investment in a renewable energy project, putting $38.8 million into two wind farms in North Dakota.. The company announced the two locations will generate 169.5 megawatts of power, enough to supply 55,000 homes.
In February 2010, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC granted Google an authorization to buy and sell energy at market rates.. The corporation exercised this authorization in September 2013 when it announced it would purchase all the electricity produced by the not-yet-built 240-megawatt Happy Hereford wind farm.In July 2010, Google signed an agreement with an Iowa wind farm to buy 114 megawatts of energy for 20 years.In December 2016, Google announced that—starting in 2017—it will power all of its data centers, as well as all of its offices, from 100% renewable energy.
The commitment will make Google "the world's largest corporate buyer of renewable power, with commitments reaching 2.6 gigawatts (2,600 megawatts) of wind and solar energy".. Google also stated that it does not count that as its final goal; it says that "since the wind doesn't blow 24 hours a day, we'll also broaden our purchases to a variety of energy sources that can enable renewable power, every hour of every day".
Additionally, the project will "help support communities" around the world, as the purchase commitments will "result in infrastructure investments of more than $3.5 billion globally", and will "generate tens of millions of dollars per year in revenue to local property owners, and tens of millions more to local and national governments in tax revenue".In November 2017, Google bought 536 megawatts of wind power.. The purchase made the firm reach 100% renewable energy.
The wind energy comes from two power plants in South Dakota, one in Iowa and one in Oklahoma.In September 2019, Google's chief executive announced plans for a $2 billion wind and solar investment, the biggest renewable energy deal in corporate history.. This will grow their green energy profile by 40%, giving them an extra 1.6 gigawatt of clean energy, the company said.Google donates to politicians who deny climate change including Jim Inhofe as well as sponsoring climate change denial political groups including the State Policy Network and the Competitive Enterprise Institute.


=== Philanthropy ===

In 2004, Google formed the not-for-profit philanthropic Google.org, with a start-up fund of $1 billion.
The mission of the organization is to create awareness about climate change, global public health, and global poverty.. One of its first projects was to develop a viable plug-in hybrid electric vehicle that can attain 100 miles per gallon.
Google hired Larry Brilliant as the program's executive director in 2004 and Megan Smith has since replaced him as director.In 2008, Google announced its "project 10100" which accepted ideas for how to help the community and then allowed Google users to vote on their favorites.. After two years of silence, during which many wondered what had happened to the program, Google revealed the winners of the project, giving a total of ten million dollars to various ideas ranging from non-profit organizations that promote education to a website that intends to make all legal documents public and online.In March 2007, in partnership with the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute (MSRI), Google hosted the first Julia Robinson Mathematics Festival at its headquarters in Mountain View.
In 2011, Google donated 1 million euros to International Mathematical Olympiad to support the next five annual International Mathematical Olympiads (2011–2015).. In July 2012, Google launched a "Legalize Love" campaign in support of gay rights.


== Criticism and controversy ==

Google's market dominance has led to prominent media coverage, including criticism of the company over issues such as aggressive tax avoidance, search neutrality, copyright, censorship of search results and content, and privacy.
Other criticisms include alleged misuse and manipulation of search results, its use of others' intellectual property, concerns that its compilation of data may violate people's privacy, and the energy consumption of its servers, as well as concerns over traditional business issues such as monopoly, restraint of trade, anti-competitive practices, and patent infringement.
Google formerly adhered to the Internet censorship policies of China, enforced by means of filters colloquially known as "The Great Firewall of China", but no longer does so.. As a result, all Google services except for Chinese Google Maps are blocked from access within mainland China without the aid of VPNs, proxy servers, or other similar technologies.
The Intercept reported in August 2018 that Google is developing for the People's Republic of China a censored version of its search engine (known as Dragonfly) "that will blacklist websites and search terms about human rights, democracy, religion, and peaceful protest".. However, the project had been withheld due to privacy concerns.Following media reports about PRISM, NSA's massive electronic surveillance program, in June 2013, several technology companies were identified as participants, including Google.
According to leaks of said program, Google joined the PRISM program in 2009.Google has worked with the United States Department of Defense on drone software through the 2017 "Project Maven" that could be used to improve the accuracy of drone strikes.. Thousands of Google employees, including senior engineers, have signed a letter urging Google CEO Sundar Pichai to end a controversial contract with the Pentagon.
In response to the backlash, Google ultimately decided to not renew their DoD contract, set to expire in 2019.Shona Ghosh, a journalist for Business Insider, noted that an increasing digital resistance movement against Google has grown.. A major hub for critics of Google in order to organize to abstain from using Google products is the Reddit page for the subreddit /r/degoogle.In July 2018, Mozilla Program Manager Chris Peterson accused Google of intentionally slowing down YouTube performance on Firefox.In April 2019 former Mozilla executive Jonathan Nightingale accused Google of intentionally and systematically sabotaging the Firefox browser over the past decade in order to boost Chrome's adoption.In November 2019, the Office for Civil Rights of the Department of Health and Human Services began investigation into Project Nightingale, to assess whether the "mass collection of individuals’ medical records" complied with HIPAA.
According to The Wall Street Journal, Google commenced the project in secret, in 2018, with St.. Louis-based healthcare company Ascension.


=== Litigation ===

Google has been involved in a number of lawsuits including the High-Tech Employee Antitrust Litigation which resulted in Google being one of four companies to pay a $415 million settlement to employees.On June 27, 2017, the company received a record fine of €2.42 billion from the European Union for "promoting its own shopping comparison service at the top of search results." Commenting on the penalty, New Scientist magazine said: "The hefty sum – the largest ever doled out by the EU's competition regulators – will sting in the short term, but Google can handle it.
Alphabet, Google’s parent company, made a profit of $2.5 billion (€2.2 billion) in the first six weeks of 2017 alone.. The real impact of the ruling is that Google must stop using its dominance as a search engine to give itself the edge in another market: online price comparisons." The company disputed the ruling.
The hearing at the General Court of Luxembourg was scheduled for 2020.. The court is going to deliver the ultimate judgment by the end of the year.On July 18, 2018, the European Commission fined Google €4.34 billion for breaching EU antitrust rules.
The abuse of dominant position has been referred to Google's constraint applied on Android device manufacturers and network operators to ensure that traffic on Android devices goes to the Google search engine.. On October 9, 2018, Google confirmed that it had appealed the fine to the General Court of the European Union.On January 21, 2019, French data regulator CNIL imposed a record €50 million fine on Google for breaching the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation.
The judgment claimed Google had failed to sufficiently inform users of its methods for collecting data to personalize advertising.. Google issued a statement saying it was “deeply committed” to transparency and was “studying the decision” before determining its response.On March 20, 2019, the European Commission imposed a €1.49 billion ($1.69 billion) fine on Google for preventing rivals from being able to “compete and innovate fairly” in the online advertising market.
European Union competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager said Google had violated EU antitrust rules by “imposing anti-competitive contractual restrictions on third-party websites” that required them to exclude search results from Google's rivals.. Kent Walker, Google's senior vice-president of global affairs, said the company had “already made a wide range of changes to our products to address the Commission’s concerns,” and that "we'll be making further updates to give more visibility to rivals in Europe."On July 25, 2019, presidential hopeful Tulsi Gabbard sued Google for blocking her ads after the presidential debate when she became one of the most searched items on the search engine.


=== DeGoogle movement ===

The DeGoogle movement is a grassroots campaign that has spawned as privacy activists urge users to stop using Google products due to growing privacy concerns regarding the company.
The term refers to the act of removing Google from one's life.

In November 2018, the company won a $480 million military contract with the U.S.
government to bring augmented reality (AR) headset technology into the weapon repertoires of American soldiers.. The two-year contract may result in follow-on orders of more than 100,000 headsets, according to documentation describing the bidding process.
One of the contract's tag lines for the augmented reality technology seems to be its ability to enable "25 bloodless battles before the 1st battle", suggesting that actual combat training is going to be an essential aspect of the augmented reality headset capabilities.


=== Marketing ===

In 2004, Microsoft commissioned research firms to do independent studies comparing the total cost of ownership (TCO) of Windows Server 2003 to Linux; the firms concluded that companies found Windows easier to administrate than Linux, thus those using Windows would administrate faster resulting in lower costs for their company (i.e.. lower TCO).
This spurred a wave of related studies; a study by the Yankee Group concluded that upgrading from one version of Windows Server to another costs a fraction of the switching costs from Windows Server to Linux, although companies surveyed noted the increased security and reliability of Linux servers and concern about being locked into using Microsoft products.. Another study, released by the Open Source Development Labs, claimed that the Microsoft studies were "simply outdated and one-sided" and their survey concluded that the TCO of Linux was lower due to Linux administrators managing more servers on average and other reasons.As part of the "Get the Facts" campaign, Microsoft highlighted the .NET Framework trading platform that it had developed in partnership with Accenture for the London Stock Exchange, claiming that it provided "five nines" reliability.
After suffering extended downtime and unreliability the London Stock Exchange announced in 2009 that it was planning to drop its Microsoft solution and switch to a Linux-based one in 2010.In 2012, Microsoft hired a political pollster named Mark Penn, whom The New York Times called "famous for bulldozing" his political opponents as Executive Vice-President, Advertising and Strategy.. Penn created a series of negative advertisements targeting one of Microsoft's chief competitors, Google.
The advertisements, called "Scroogled", attempt to make the case that Google is "screwing" consumers with search results rigged to favor Google's paid advertisers, that Gmail violates the privacy of its users to place ad results related to the content of their emails and shopping results, which favor Google products.. Tech publications like TechCrunch have been highly critical of the advertising campaign, while Google employees have embraced it.


=== Layoffs ===

In July 2014, Microsoft announced plans to lay off 18,000 employees.
Microsoft employed 127,104 people as of June 5, 2014, making this about a 14 percent reduction of its workforce as the biggest Microsoft lay off ever.. This included 12,500 professional and factory personnel.
Previously, Microsoft had eliminated 5,800 jobs in 2009 in line with the Great Recession of 2008–2017.. In September 2014, Microsoft laid off 2,100 people, including 747 people in the Seattle–Redmond area, where the company is headquartered.
The firings came as a second wave of the layoffs that were previously announced.. This brought the total number to over 15,000 out of the 18,000 expected cuts.
In October 2014, Microsoft revealed that it was almost done with the elimination of 18,000 employees, which was its largest-ever layoff sweep.. In July 2015, Microsoft announced another 7,800 job cuts in the next several months.
In May 2016, Microsoft announced another 1,850 job cuts mostly in (Nokia) mobile phone division.. As a result, the company will record an impairment and restructuring charge of approximately $950 million, of which approximately $200 million will relate to severance payments.


=== United States government ===

Microsoft provides information about reported bugs in their software to intelligence agencies of the United States government, prior to the public release of the fix.
A Microsoft spokesperson has stated that the corporation runs several programs that facilitate the sharing of such information with the U.S.. government.
Following media reports about PRISM, NSA's massive electronic surveillance program, in May 2013, several technology companies were identified as participants, including Microsoft.. According to leaks of said program, Microsoft joined the PRISM program in 2007.
However, in June 2013, an official statement from Microsoft flatly denied their participation in the program: "We provide customer data only when we receive a legally binding order or subpoena to do so, and never on a voluntary basis.. In addition we only ever comply with orders for requests about specific accounts or identifiers.
If the government has a broader voluntary national security program to gather customer data, we don't participate in it."
During the first six months in 2013, Microsoft had received requests that affected between 15,000 and 15,999 accounts.. In December 2013, the company made statement to further emphasize the fact that they take their customers' privacy and data protection very seriously, even saying that "government snooping potentially now constitutes an "advanced persistent threat," alongside sophisticated malware and cyber attacks".
The statement also marked the beginning of three-part program to enhance Microsoft's encryption and transparency efforts.. On July 1, 2014, as part of this program they opened the first (of many) Microsoft Transparency Center, that provides "participating governments with the ability to review source code for our key products, assure themselves of their software integrity, and confirm there are no "back doors." Microsoft has also argued that the United States Congress should enact strong privacy regulations to protect consumer data.In April 2016, the company sued the U.S.
government, arguing that secrecy orders were preventing the company from disclosing warrants to customers in violation of the company's and customers' rights.. Microsoft argued that it was unconstitutional for the government to indefinitely ban Microsoft from informing its users that the government was requesting their emails and other documents, and that the Fourth Amendment made it so people or businesses had the right to know if the government searches or seizes their property.
On October 23, 2017, Microsoft said it would drop the lawsuit as a result of a policy change by the United States Department of Justice (DoJ).. The DoJ had "changed data request rules on alerting Internet users about agencies accessing their information."


== Corporate identity ==


=== Corporate culture ===
Technical reference for developers and articles for various Microsoft magazines such as Microsoft Systems Journal (MSJ) are available through the Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN).
MSDN also offers subscriptions for companies and individuals, and the more expensive subscriptions usually offer access to pre-release beta versions of Microsoft software.. In April 2004 Microsoft launched a community site for developers and users, titled Channel 9, that provides a wiki and an Internet forum.
Another community site that provides daily videocasts and other services, On10.net, launched on March 3, 2006.. Free technical support is traditionally provided through online Usenet newsgroups, and CompuServe in the past, monitored by Microsoft employees; there can be several newsgroups for a single product.
Helpful people can be elected by peers or Microsoft employees for Microsoft Most Valuable Professional (MVP) status, which entitles them to a sort of special social status and possibilities for awards and other benefits.Noted for its internal lexicon, the expression "eating your own dog food" is used to describe the policy of using pre-release and beta versions of products inside Microsoft in an effort to test them in "real-world" situations.. This is usually shortened to just "dog food" and is used as noun, verb, and adjective.
Another bit of jargon, FYIFV or FYIV ("Fuck You, I'm [Fully] Vested"), is used by an employee to indicate they are financially independent and can avoid work anytime they wish.. The company is also known for its hiring process, mimicked in other organizations and dubbed the "Microsoft interview", which is notorious for off-the-wall questions such as "Why is a manhole cover round?".Microsoft is an outspoken opponent of the cap on H-1B visas, which allow companies in the U.S.
to employ certain foreign workers.. Bill Gates claims the cap on H1B visas makes it difficult to hire employees for the company, stating "I'd certainly get rid of the H1B cap" in 2005.
Critics of H1B visas argue that relaxing the limits would result in increased unemployment for U.S.. citizens due to H1B workers working for lower salaries.
The Human Rights Campaign Corporate Equality Index, a report of how progressive the organization deems company policies towards LGBT employees, rated Microsoft as 87% from 2002 to 2004 and as 100% from 2005 to 2010 after they allowed gender expression.In August 2018, Microsoft implemented a policy for all companies providing subcontractors to require 12 weeks of paid parental leave to each employee.. This expands on the former requirement from 2015 requiring 15 days of paid vacation and sick leave each year.
In 2015, Microsoft established its own parental leave policy to allow 12 weeks off for parental leave with an additional 8 weeks for the parent who gave birth.


=== Environment ===
In 2011, Greenpeace released a report rating the top ten big brands in cloud computing on their sources of electricity for their data centers.. At the time, data centers consumed up to 2% of all global electricity and this amount was projected to increase.
Phil Radford of Greenpeace said "we are concerned that this new explosion in electricity use could lock us into old, polluting energy sources instead of the clean energy available today," and called on "Amazon, Microsoft and other leaders of the information-technology industry must embrace clean energy to power their cloud-based data centers." In 2013, Microsoft agreed to buy power generated by a Texas wind project to power one of its data centers.. Microsoft is ranked on the 17th place in Greenpeace's Guide to Greener Electronics (16th Edition) that ranks 18 electronics manufacturers according to their policies on toxic chemicals, recycling and climate change.
Microsoft's timeline for phasing out brominated flame retardant (BFRs) and phthalates in all products is 2012 but its commitment to phasing out PVC is not clear.. As of January 2011, it has no products that are completely free from PVC and BFRs.Microsoft's main U.S.
campus received a silver certification from the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) program in 2008, and it installed over 2,000 solar panels on top of its buildings at its Silicon Valley campus, generating approximately 15 percent of the total energy needed by the facilities in April 2005.. Microsoft makes use of alternative forms of transit.
It created one of the world's largest private bus systems, the "Connector", to transport people from outside the company; for on-campus transportation, the "Shuttle Connect" uses a large fleet of hybrid cars to save fuel.. The company also subsidizes regional public transport, provided by Sound Transit and King County Metro, as an incentive.
In February 2010 however, Microsoft took a stance against adding additional public transport and high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes to the State Route 520 and its floating bridge connecting Redmond to Seattle; the company did not want to delay the construction any further.. Microsoft was ranked number 1 in the list of the World's Best Multinational Workplaces by the Great Place to Work Institute in 2011.
In January 2020, the company promised to remove from the environment all of the carbon that it has emitted since its foundation in 1975.Microsoft donates to politicians who deny climate change including Jim Inhofe.


=== Headquarters ===

The corporate headquarters, informally known as the Microsoft Redmond campus, is located at One Microsoft Way in Redmond, Washington.. Microsoft initially moved onto the grounds of the campus on February 26, 1986, weeks before the company went public on March 13.
The headquarters has since experienced multiple expansions since its establishment.. It is estimated to encompass over 8 million ft2 (750,000 m2) of office space and 30,000–40,000 employees.
Additional offices are located in Bellevue and Issaquah, Washington (90,000 employees worldwide).. The company is planning to upgrade its Mountain View, California, campus on a grand scale.
The company has occupied this campus since 1981.. In 2016, the company bought the 32-acre campus, with plans to renovate and expand it by 25%.
Microsoft operates an East Coast headquarters in Charlotte, North Carolina.


=== Flagship stores ===

On October 26, 2015, the company opened its retail location on Fifth Avenue in New York City.. The location features a five-story glass storefront and is 22,270 square feet.
As per company executives, Microsoft had been on the lookout for a flagship location since 2009.. The company's retail locations are part of a greater
strategy to help build a connection with its consumers.
The
opening of the store coincided with the launch of the Surface Book and Surface
Pro 4.. On November 12, 2015, Microsoft opened a second flagship store, located in Sydney's Pitt Street Mall.


=== Logo ===
Microsoft adopted the so-called "Pac-Man Logo", designed by Scott Baker, in 1987.
Baker stated "The new logo, in Helvetica italic typeface, has a slash between the o and s to emphasize the "soft" part of the name and convey motion and speed." Dave Norris ran an internal joke campaign to save the old logo, which was green, in all uppercase, and featured a fanciful letter O, nicknamed the blibbet, but it was discarded.. Microsoft's logo with the tagline "Your potential.
Our passion."—below the main corporate name—is based on a slogan Microsoft used in 2008.. In 2002, the company started using the logo in the United States and eventually started a television campaign with the slogan, changed from the previous tagline of "Where do you want to go today?" During the private MGX (Microsoft Global Exchange) conference in 2010, Microsoft unveiled the company's next tagline, "Be What's Next." They also had a slogan/tagline "Making it all make sense."On August 23, 2012, Microsoft unveiled a new corporate logo at the opening of its 23rd Microsoft store in Boston, indicating the company's shift of focus from the classic style to the tile-centric modern interface, which it uses/will use on the Windows Phone platform, Xbox 360, Windows 8 and the upcoming Office Suites.
The new logo also includes four squares with the colors of the then-current Windows logo which have been used to represent Microsoft's four major products: Windows (blue), Office (red), Xbox (green) and Bing (yellow).. The logo resembles the opening of one of the commercials for Windows 95.

=== Pests and diseases ===

Apple trees are susceptible to a number of fungal and bacterial diseases and insect pests.. Many commercial orchards pursue a program of chemical sprays to maintain high fruit quality, tree health, and high yields.
These prohibit the use of synthetic pesticides, though some older pesticides are allowed.. Organic methods include, for instance, introducing its natural predator to reduce the population of a particular pest.
A wide range of pests and diseases can affect the plant.
Three of the more common diseases or pests are mildew, aphids, and apple scab.

Mildew is characterized by light grey powdery patches appearing on the leaves, shoots and flowers, normally in spring.. The flowers turn a creamy yellow color and do not develop correctly.
This can be treated similarly to Botrytis—eliminating the conditions that caused the disease and burning the infected plants are among recommended actions.
Aphids are a small insect.. Five species of aphids commonly attack apples: apple grain aphid, rosy apple aphid, apple aphid, spirea aphid, and the woolly apple aphid.
The aphid species can be identified by color, time of year, and by differences in the cornicles (small paired projections from their rear).. Aphids feed on foliage using needle-like mouth parts to suck out plant juices.
When present in high numbers, certain species reduce tree growth and vigor.
Apple scab: Apple scab causes leaves to develop olive-brown spots with a velvety texture that later turn brown and become cork-like in texture.. The disease also affects the fruit, which also develops similar brown spots with velvety or cork-like textures.
Apple scab is spread through fungus growing in old apple leaves on the ground and spreads during warm spring weather to infect the new year's growth.Among the most serious disease problems are a bacterial disease called fireblight, and two fungal diseases: Gymnosporangium rust and black spot.. Other pests that affect apple trees include Codling moths and apple maggots.
Young apple trees are also prone to mammal pests like mice and deer, which feed on the soft bark of the trees, especially in winter.. The larvae of the apple clearwing moth (red-belted clearwing) burrow through the bark and into the phloem of apple trees, potentially causing significant damage.


== Production ==

World production of apples in 2018 was 86 million tonnes, with China producing 46% of the total (table).
Secondary producers were the United States and Poland.


== Nutrition ==
A raw apple is 86% water and 14% carbohydrates, with negligible content of fat and protein (table).. A reference serving of a raw apple with skin weighing 100 grams provides 52 calories and a moderate content of dietary fiber.
Otherwise, there is low content of all micronutrients (table).


== Uses ==

All parts of the fruit, including the skin, except for the seeds, are suitable for human consumption.. The core, from stem to bottom, containing the seeds, is usually not eaten and is discarded.
Apples can be consumed various ways: juice, raw in salads, baked in pies, cooked into sauces and spreads like apple butter, and other baked dishes.Several techniques are used to preserve apples and apple products.
Apples can be canned, dried or frozen.. Canned or frozen apples are eventually baked into pies or other cooked dishes.
Apple juice or cider is also bottled.. Apple juice is often concentrated and frozen.


=== Popular uses ===
Apples are often eaten raw.
Cultivars bred for raw consumption are termed dessert or table apples.

In the UK, a toffee apple is a traditional confection made by coating an apple in hot toffee and allowing it to cool.. Similar treats in the U.S.
are candy apples (coated in a hard shell of crystallized sugar syrup) and caramel apples (coated with cooled caramel).
Apples are eaten with honey at the Jewish New Year of Rosh Hashanah to symbolize a sweet new year.Apples are an important ingredient in many desserts, such as apple pie, apple crumble, apple crisp and apple cake.. When cooked, some apple cultivars easily form a puree known as apple sauce.
Apples are also made into apple butter and apple jelly.. They are often baked or stewed and are also (cooked) in some meat dishes.
Dried apples can be eaten or reconstituted (soaked in water, alcohol or some other liquid).
Apples are milled or pressed to produce apple juice, which may be drunk unfiltered (called apple cider in North America), or filtered.. Filtered juice is often concentrated and frozen, then reconstituted later and consumed.
Apple juice can be fermented to make cider (called hard cider in North America), ciderkin, and vinegar.. Through distillation, various alcoholic beverages can be produced, such as applejack, Calvados, and apfelwein.


=== Organic production ===
Organic apples are commonly produced in the United States.
Due to infestations by key insects and diseases, organic production is difficult in Europe.. The use of pesticides containing chemicals, such as sulfur, copper, microorganisms, viruses, clay powders, or plant extracts (pyrethrum, neem) has been approved by the EU Organic Standing Committee to improve organic yield and quality.
A light coating of kaolin, which forms a physical barrier to some pests, also may help prevent apple sun scalding.


=== Phytochemicals ===
Apple skins and seeds contain various phytochemicals, particularly polyphenols which are under preliminary research for their potential health effects.


=== Non-browning apples ===
The enzyme, polyphenol oxidase, causes browning in sliced or bruised apples, by catalyzing the oxidation of phenolic compounds to o-quinones, a browning factor.. Browning reduces apple taste, color, and food value.
Arctic Apples, a non-browning group of apples introduced to the United States market in 2019, have been genetically modified to silence the expression of polyphenol oxidase, thereby delaying a browning effect and improving apple eating quality.. The US Food and Drug Administration in 2015, and Canadian Food Inspection Agency in 2017, determined that Arctic apples are as safe and nutritious as conventional apples.


=== Other products ===
Apple seed oil is obtained by pressing apple seeds for manufacturing cosmetics.


=== Research ===
Preliminary research is investigating whether apple consumption may affect the risk of some types of cancer.


=== Allergy ===
One form of apple allergy, often found in northern Europe, is called birch-apple syndrome and is found in people who are also allergic to birch pollen.
Allergic reactions are triggered by a protein in apples that is similar to birch pollen, and people affected by this protein can also develop allergies to other fruits, nuts, and vegetables.. Reactions, which entail oral allergy syndrome (OAS), generally involve itching and inflammation of the mouth and throat, but in rare cases can also include life-threatening anaphylaxis.
This reaction only occurs when raw fruit is consumed—the allergen is neutralized in the cooking process.. The variety of apple, maturity and storage conditions can change the amount of allergen present in individual fruits.
Long storage times can increase the amount of proteins that cause birch-apple syndrome.In other areas, such as the Mediterranean, some individuals have adverse reactions to apples because of their similarity to peaches.. This form of apple allergy also includes OAS, but often has more severe symptoms, such as vomiting, abdominal pain and urticaria, and can be life-threatening.
Individuals with this form of allergy can also develop reactions to other fruits and nuts.. Cooking does not break down the protein causing this particular reaction, so affected individuals cannot eat raw or cooked apples.
Freshly harvested, over-ripe fruits tend to have the highest levels of the protein that causes this reaction.Breeding efforts have yet to produce a hypoallergenic fruit suitable for either of the two forms of apple allergy.


=== Toxicity of seeds ===
Apple seeds contain small amounts of amygdalin, a sugar and cyanide compound known as a cyanogenic glycoside.. Ingesting small amounts of apple seeds causes no ill effects, but consumption of extremely large doses can cause adverse reactions.
It may take several hours before the poison takes effect, as cyanogenic glycosides must be hydrolyzed before the cyanide ion is released.. The United States National Library of Medicine's Hazardous Substances Data Bank records no cases of amygdalin poisoning from consuming apple seeds.

At the end of 2012, Mail.ru Group bought the Ukrainian email service mail.ua and the registration of email addresses using this domain started on 23 April 2013.In September 2018, Alibaba announced buying a 10% stake in Mail.Ru, which would have a value of $484 million based on Mail.Ru's market capitalization on 10 September 2018.


== Statistics ==
According to Alexa data for June 2007, Mail.ru was the most popular Russian site on the web.
In 2005 there were more than 30 million users with 25 million emails a day.
By the end of 2006 it was announced that a strategic agreement with Yandex was achieved about the use of a Yandex search engine instead of Google.
This has been reversed in January 2010.. This collaboration was dropped in November 2012, with migration to its own engine, which ended in mid-2013.
In January 2007 30% shares of Mail.ru were bought by South African company Naspers for $165 million, and by 2019, the Naspers spin-off Prosus had 28% of Mail.Ru.

== Controversies ==
On 15 May 2017, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko signed a decree to impose a ban on Mail.ru and its widely used social networks including VKontakte and Odnoklassniki as part of its continued sanctions on Russia for its annexation of Crimea and involvement in the War in Donbass.
The move was widely criticised as censorship, and Reporters Without Borders condemned the ban, calling it a "disproportionate measure that seriously undermines the Ukrainian people's right to information and freedom of expression." Mail.ru itself estimated (in August 2017) that the ban had cost them around 1.5% of total revenues in 2017.In 5 November 2017, the Paradise Papers, a set of confidential electronic documents relating to offshore investment, revealed that Russian state organizations with ties to Vladimir Putin pursued between 2009 and 2011 large investments in Facebook and Twitter via an intermediary—Russian-American billionaire and entrepreneur Yuri Milner, founder of Mail.Ru and DST Global, who befriended Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and was a business associate of Jared Kushner, President Donald Trump's son-in-law.A Kremlin-owned firm, VTB Bank, put $191 million into DST Global, which used it to buy a large share of Twitter in 2011.. A subsidiary of the Kremlin-controlled Gazprom funded an investment company that partnered with DST Global to buy shares in Facebook, reaping millions when the social media giant went public in 2012.
Twitter similarly went public in 2013.. The US government sanctioned VTB in 2014 because of the Russian military intervention in Crimea, but DST Global had sold its stake in Twitter by then.
Four days after the Facebook IPO, a DST Global subsidiary sold more than 27 million shares of Facebook for roughly $1 billion.

Mail.ru Portal (in Russian)Upon successful graduation, they were awarded a specialist degree in Applied Mathematics and Physics and, beginning in the early 1990s, a Master's degree in Physics.
Since 1998, students have been awarded a Bachelor's degree diploma after four years of study and the defense of a Bachelor's "qualification work" (effectively a smaller and less involved version of the Master's thesis).. An estimated 90% of students continue their education after receiving this diploma to complete the full six-year curriculum and receive the Master's degree.
The full course of education at MIPT takes six years to complete, just like an American Bachelor's degree followed by a Master's degree.
However, MIPT graduates usually view their training as effectively higher than an American M.S.. in Physics.
The MIPT curriculum is, indeed, considerably more extensive compared to an average American college.. In addition, American M.S.
programs usually focus more on classroom education and less on research.. There is an opinion that an MIPT specialist/Master's diploma may be roughly equivalent to an American Ph.D.
in physics.Traditional university rankings are based on the universities' research output and prizes won by faculty.. In contrast, many distinguished professors teaching at MIPT are officially on staff at the base institutes (see above) rather than MIPT itself.
Student research work is also typically carried out outside of MIPT and published research results do not mention MIPT.. In effect, many MIPT professors are not considered as such for the rankings and student research is not earning any ranking points for MIPT.


== People ==


=== Demographics ===
About 15% of all students are residents of Moscow and nearly the same are from Moscow region; the rest come from all over the former Soviet Union.
Most out-of-town students live in the dormitory on campus for at least the first 4 years.. Many senior students move to another dormitory in Moscow, while some either move to base institute dormitories or rent apartments.
The student population is almost exclusively male, with the female/male ratio in a department rarely exceeding 15% (seeing 2–3 women in a class of 80 is not uncommon).
In recent years, this situation has changed and in 2009 more than 20% of first year students were females.There are no reliable statistics on the careers of MIPT graduates.. Prior to the collapse of the Soviet Union, most MIPT graduates continued research at their base institutes or found jobs in OKBs.
Nowadays, many graduates become business people or software engineers.. Some, especially high-performing students of prestigious departments (e.g.
DGAP, DCAM), go on to get post-graduate degrees from foreign universities.. In the past, some students were known to have been admitted into Ph.D.
programs of American universities as early as after their 3rd year of education.. Many MIPT alumni hold faculty positions in the world's top Universities, including Harvard, University of Manchester, Princeton University, MIT, Columbia, Stanford, Brown, University of Chicago, University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign and the University of Wisconsin–Madison.

Official website (in English)
Official website (in Russian)Euler diagrams consist of simple closed curves (usually circles) in the plane that depict sets.. Each Euler curve divides the plane into two regions or "zones": the interior, which symbolically represents the elements of the set, and the exterior, which represents all elements that are not members of the set.
The sizes or shapes of the curves are not important; the significance of the diagram is in how they overlap.. The spatial relationships between the regions bounded by each curve (overlap, containment or neither) corresponds to set-theoretic relationships (intersection, subset and disjointness).
Curves whose interior zones do not intersect represent disjoint sets.. Two curves whose interior zones intersect represent sets that have common elements; the zone inside both curves represents the set of elements common to both sets (the intersection of the sets).
A curve that is contained completely within the interior zone of another represents a subset of it.. Euler diagrams (and their generalization in Venn diagrams) were incorporated as part of instruction in set theory as part of the new math movement in the 1960s.
Since then, they have also been adopted by other curriculum fields such as reading.


=== Music ===
Even when dealing with music, Euler's approach is mainly mathematical.. His writings on music are not particularly numerous (a few hundred pages, in his total production of about thirty thousand pages), but they reflect an early preoccupation and one that did not leave him throughout his life.A first point of Euler's musical theory is the definition of "genres", i.e.
of possible divisions of the octave using the prime numbers 3 and 5.. Euler describes 18 such genres, with the general definition 2mA, where A is the "exponent" of the genre (i.e.
the sum of the exponents of 3 and 5) and 2m (where "m is an indefinite number, small or large, so long as the sounds are perceptible"), expresses that the relation holds independently of the number of octaves concerned.. The first genre, with A = 1, is the octave itself (or its duplicates); the second genre, 2m.3, is the octave divided by the fifth (fifth + fourth, C–G–C); the third genre is 2m.5, major third + minor sixth (C–E–C); the fourth is 2m.32, two-fourths and a tone (C–F–B♭–C); the fifth is 2m.3.5 (C–E–G–B–C); etc.
Genres 12 (2m.33.5), 13 (2m.32.52) and 14 (2m.3.53) are corrected versions of the diatonic, chromatic and enharmonic, respectively, of the Ancients.. Genre 18 (2m.33.52) is the "diatonico-chromatic", "used generally in all compositions", and which turns out to be identical with the system described by Johann Mattheson.
Euler later envisaged the possibility of describing genres including the prime number 7.Euler devised a specific graph, the Speculum musicum, to illustrate the diatonico-chromatic genre, and discussed paths in this graph for specific intervals, recalling his interest in the Seven Bridges of Königsberg (see above).. The device drew renewed interest as the Tonnetz in neo-Riemannian theory (see also Lattice (music)).Euler further used the principle of the "exponent" to propose a derivation of the gradus suavitatis (degree of suavity, of agreeableness) of intervals and chords from their prime factors – one must keep in mind that he considered just intonation, i.e.
1 and the prime numbers 3 and 5 only.. Formulas have been proposed extending this system to any number of prime numbers, e.g.
in the form

ds = Σ (kipi – ki) + 1where pi are prime numbers and ki their exponents.


== Personal philosophy and religious beliefs ==
Euler and his friend Daniel Bernoulli were opponents of Leibniz's monadism and the philosophy of Christian Wolff.. Euler insisted that knowledge is founded in part on the basis of precise quantitative laws, something that monadism and Wolffian science were unable to provide.
Euler's religious leanings might also have had a bearing on his dislike of the doctrine; he went so far as to label Wolff's ideas as "heathen and atheistic".Much of what is known of Euler's religious beliefs can be deduced from his Letters to a German Princess and an earlier work, Rettung der Göttlichen Offenbahrung Gegen die Einwürfe der Freygeister (Defense of the Divine Revelation against the Objections of the Freethinkers).. These works show that Euler was a devout Christian who believed the Bible to be inspired; the Rettung was primarily an argument for the divine inspiration of scripture.There is a famous legend inspired by Euler's arguments with secular philosophers over religion, which is set during Euler's second stint at the St.
Petersburg Academy.. The French philosopher Denis Diderot was visiting Russia on Catherine the Great's invitation.
However, the Empress was alarmed that the philosopher's arguments for atheism were influencing members of her court, and so Euler was asked to confront the Frenchman.. Diderot was informed that a learned mathematician had produced a proof of the existence of God: he agreed to view the proof as it was presented in court.
Euler appeared, advanced toward Diderot, and in a tone of perfect conviction announced this non-sequitur: "Sir, a+bn/n=x, hence God exists—reply!"
Diderot, to whom (says the story) all mathematics was gibberish, stood dumbstruck as peals of laughter erupted from the court.. Embarrassed, he asked to leave Russia, a request that was graciously granted by the Empress.
However amusing the anecdote may be, it is apocryphal, given that Diderot himself did research in mathematics.
The legend was apparently first told by
Dieudonné Thiébault with embellishment by Augustus De Morgan.


== Commemorations ==

Euler was featured on the sixth series of the Swiss 10-franc banknote and on numerous Swiss, German, and Russian postage stamps.. The asteroid 2002 Euler was named in his honor.
He is also commemorated by the Lutheran Church on their Calendar of Saints on 24 May—he was a devout Christian (and believer in biblical inerrancy) who wrote apologetics and argued forcefully against the prominent atheists of his time.


== Selected bibliography ==
Euler has an extensive bibliography.. His best-known books include:

Mechanica (1736).
Methodus inveniendi lineas curvas maximi minimive proprietate gaudentes, sive solutio problematis isoperimetrici latissimo sensu accepti (1744).
The Latin title translates as a method for finding curved lines enjoying properties of maximum or minimum, or solution of isoperimetric problems in the broadest accepted sense.

The proportion of foreign-born people in the UK remains slightly below that of many other European countries.Immigration is now contributing to a rising population with arrivals and UK-born children of migrants accounting for about half of the population increase between 1991 and 2001.
Over a quarter (27.0 per cent) of live births in 2014 were to mothers born outside the UK, according to official statistics released in 2015.. Analysis of Office for National Statistics (ONS) data shows that a net total of 2.3 million migrants moved to the UK in the 15 years from 1991 to 2006.
The ONS reported that net migration rose from 2009 to 2010 by 21 per cent to 239,000.In 2013, approximately 208,000 foreign nationals were naturalised as British citizens, the highest number since records began in 1962.. This figure fell to around 125,800 in 2014.
Between 2009 and 2013, the average number of people granted British citizenship per year was 195,800.. The main countries of previous nationality of those naturalised in 2014 were India, Pakistan, the Philippines, Nigeria, Bangladesh, Nepal, China, [[[South Africa]], Poland and Somalia.
The total number of grants of settlement, which confers permanent residence in the UK without granting British citizenship, was approximately 154,700 in 2013, compared to 241,200 in 2010 and 129,800 in 2012.

From 2008, the British Government introduced a points-based immigration system for immigration from outside the European Economic Area to replace former schemes, including the Scottish Government's Fresh Talent Initiative.. In June 2010 a temporary limit of 24,000 on immigration from outside the EU was introduced, aiming to discourage applications before a permanent cap was imposed in April 2011.Emigration was an important feature of British society in the 19th century.
Between 1815 and 1930 around 11.4 million people emigrated from Britain and 7.3 million from Ireland.. Estimates show that by the end of the 20th century some 300 million people of British and Irish descent were permanently settled around the globe.
Today, at least 5.5 million UK-born people live abroad, mainly in Australia, Spain, the United States and Canada.


=== Education ===

Education in the United Kingdom is a devolved matter, with each country having a separate education system.
Considering the four systems together, about 38 per cent of the United Kingdom population has a university or college degree, which is the highest percentage in Europe, and among the highest percentages in the world.. The United Kingdom trails only the United States in terms of representation on lists of top 100 universities.A government commission's report in 2014 found that privately educated people comprise 7 per cent of the general population of the UK but much larger percentages of the top professions, the most extreme case quoted being 71 per cent of senior judges.England

Whilst education in England is the responsibility of the Secretary of State for Education, the day-to-day administration and funding of state schools is the responsibility of local authorities.
Universally free of charge state education was introduced piecemeal between 1870 and 1944.. Education is now mandatory from ages five to sixteen, and in England youngsters must stay in education or training until they are 18.
In 2011, the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) rated 13–14-year-old pupils in England and Wales 10th in the world for maths and 9th for science.. The majority of children are educated in state-sector schools, a small proportion of which select on the grounds of academic ability.
Two of the top ten performing schools in terms of GCSE results in 2006 were state-run grammar schools.. In 2010, over half of places at the University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge were taken by students from state schools, while the proportion of children in England attending private schools is around 7 per cent, which rises to 18 per cent of those over 16.
England has the two oldest universities in English-speaking world, Universities of Oxford and Cambridge (jointly known as "Oxbridge") with history of over eight centuries.Since the establishment of Bedford College (London), Girton College (Cambridge) and Somerville College (Oxford) in the 19th century, women also can obtain a university degree.

Scotland

Education in Scotland is the responsibility of the Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning, with day-to-day administration and funding of state schools the responsibility of Local Authorities.. Two non-departmental public bodies have key roles in Scottish education.
The Scottish Qualifications Authority is responsible for the development, accreditation, assessment and certification of qualifications other than degrees which are delivered at secondary schools, post-secondary colleges of further education and other centres.. Learning and Teaching Scotland provides advice, resources and staff development to education professionals.
Scotland first legislated for compulsory education in 1496.. The proportion of children in Scotland attending private schools is just over 4 per cent in 2016, but it has been falling slowly in recent years.
Scottish students who attend Scottish universities pay neither tuition fees nor graduate endowment charges, as fees were abolished in 2001 and the graduate endowment scheme was abolished in 2008.Wales

The Welsh Government's Minister for Education has responsibility for education in Wales.. A significant number of Welsh students are taught either wholly or largely in the Welsh language; lessons in Welsh are compulsory for all until the age of 16.
As part of the Welsh Government's long-term vision of achieving a million Welsh speakers in Wales by 2050, there are plans to increase the proportion of learners in each school year group receiving Welsh-medium education from 22 per cent in 2017 to 40 per cent by 2050.Northern Ireland

Education in Northern Ireland is the responsibility of the Minister of Education, although responsibility at a local level is administered by the Education Authority which is further sub-divided into five geographical areas.. The Council for the Curriculum, Examinations & Assessment (CCEA) is the body responsible for advising the government on what should be taught in Northern Ireland's schools, monitoring standards and awarding qualifications.


=== Health ===

Healthcare in the United Kingdom is a devolved matter and each country has its own system of private and publicly funded health care.
Public healthcare is provided to all UK permanent residents and is mostly free at the point of need, being paid for from general taxation.. The World Health Organization, in 2000, ranked the provision of healthcare in the United Kingdom as fifteenth best in Europe and eighteenth in the world.
Since 1979 expenditure on healthcare has been increased significantly to bring it closer to the European Union average.. The UK spends around 8.4 per cent of its gross domestic product on healthcare, which is 0.5 percentage points below the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development average and about one percentage point below the average of the European Union.Regulatory bodies are organised on a UK-wide basis such as the General Medical Council, the Nursing and Midwifery Council and non-governmental-based, such as the Royal Colleges.
Political and operational responsibility for healthcare lies with four national executives; healthcare in England is the responsibility of the UK Government; healthcare in Northern Ireland is the responsibility of the Northern Ireland Executive; healthcare in Scotland is the responsibility of the Scottish Government; and healthcare in Wales is the responsibility of the Welsh Government.. Each National Health Service has different policies and priorities, resulting in contrasts.


== Culture ==

The culture of the United Kingdom has been influenced by many factors including: the nation's island status; its history as a western liberal democracy and a major power; as well as being a political union of four countries with each preserving elements of distinctive traditions, customs and symbolism.
As a result of the British Empire, British influence can be observed in the language, culture and legal systems of many of its former colonies including Australia, Canada, India, Ireland, New Zealand, Pakistan, South Africa and the United States; a common culture conned today as the Anglosphere.. The substantial cultural influence of the United Kingdom has led it to be described as a "cultural superpower".
A global opinion poll for the BBC saw the United Kingdom ranked the third most positively viewed nation in the world (behind Germany and Canada) in 2013 and 2014.

The best-known of the Anglo-Welsh poets are both Thomases.. Dylan Thomas became famous on both sides of the Atlantic in the mid-20th century.
He is remembered for his poetry – his "Do not go gentle into that good night; Rage, rage against the dying of the light" is one of the most quoted couplets of English language verse – and for his "play for voices", Under Milk Wood.. The influential Church in Wales "poet-priest" and Welsh nationalist R.

=== Cuisine ===

British cuisine developed from various influences reflective of its land, settlements, arrivals of new settlers and immigrants, trade and colonialism.. Celtic agriculture and animal breeding produced a wide variety of foodstuffs for indigenous Celts and Britons.
Anglo-Saxon England developed meat and savoury herb stewing techniques before the practice became common in Europe.. The Norman conquest introduced exotic spices into England in the Middle Ages.
The British Empire facilitated a knowledge of Indian cuisine with its "strong, penetrating spices and herbs".. British cuisine has absorbed the cultural influence of those who have settled in Britain, producing many hybrid dishes, such as the Anglo-Indian chicken tikka masala.


=== Media ===

The BBC, founded in 1922, is the UK's publicly funded radio, television and Internet broadcasting corporation, and is the oldest and largest broadcaster in the world.
It operates numerous television and radio stations in the UK and abroad and its domestic services are funded by the television licence..

Sales of newspapers have fallen since the 1970s and in 2010 41 per cent of people reported reading a daily national newspaper.. In 2010, 82.5 per cent of the UK population were Internet users, the highest proportion amongst the 20 countries with the largest total number of users in that year.


=== Philosophy ===

The United Kingdom is famous for the tradition of 'British Empiricism', a branch of the philosophy of knowledge that states that only knowledge verified by experience is valid, and 'Scottish Philosophy', sometimes referred to as the 'Scottish School of Common Sense'.
The most famous philosophers of British Empiricism are John Locke, George Berkeley and David Hume; while Dugald Stewart, Thomas Reid and William Hamilton were major exponents of the Scottish "common sense" school.. Two Britons are also notable for the ethical theory of utilitarianism, a moral philosophy first used by Jeremy Bentham and later by John Stuart Mill in his short work Utilitarianism.


=== Sport ===

Association football, tennis, rugby union, rugby league, golf, boxing, netball, rowing and cricket originated or were substantially developed in the UK, with the rules and codes of many modern sports invented and codified in late 19th century Victorian Britain.
In 2012, the President of the IOC, Jacques Rogge, stated, "This great, sports-loving country is widely recognised as the birthplace of modern sport.. It was here that the concepts of sportsmanship and fair play were first codified into clear rules and regulations.
It was here that sport was included as an educational tool in the school curriculum".In most international competitions, separate teams represent England, Scotland and Wales.. Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland usually field a single team representing all of Ireland, with notable exceptions being association football and the Commonwealth Games.
In sporting contexts, the English, Scottish, Welsh and Irish / Northern Irish teams are often referred to collectively as the Home Nations.. There are some sports in which a single team represents the whole of United Kingdom, including the Olympics, where the UK is represented by the Great Britain team.
The 1908, 1948 and 2012 Summer Olympics were held in London, making it the first city to host the games three times.. Britain has participated in every modern Olympic Games to date and is third in the medal count.A 2003 poll found that football is the most popular sport in the United Kingdom.
England is recognised by FIFA as the birthplace of club football, and The Football Association is the oldest of its kind, with the rules of football first drafted in 1863 by Ebenezer Cobb Morley.. Each of the Home Nations has its own football association, national team and league system.

Cricket was invented in England, and its laws were established by Marylebone Cricket Club in 1788.
The England cricket team, controlled by the England and Wales Cricket Board, and the Irish cricket team, controlled by Cricket Ireland are the only national teams in the UK with Test status.. Team members are drawn from the main county sides, and include both English and Welsh players.
Cricket is distinct from football and rugby where Wales and England field separate national teams, although Wales had fielded its own team in the past.. Irish and Scottish players have played for England because neither Scotland nor Ireland have Test status and have only recently started to play in One Day Internationals.
Scotland, England (and Wales), and Ireland (including Northern Ireland) have competed at the Cricket World Cup, with England winning the tournament in 2019.. There is a professional league championship in which clubs representing 17 English counties and 1 Welsh county compete.

The modern game of tennis originated in Birmingham, England, in the 1860s, before spreading around the world.
The world's oldest tennis tournament, the Wimbledon championships, first occurred in 1877, and today the event takes place over two weeks in late June and early July.Thoroughbred racing, which originated under Charles II of England as the "sport of kings", is popular throughout the UK with world-famous races including the Grand National, the Epsom Derby, Royal Ascot and the Cheltenham National Hunt Festival (including the Cheltenham Gold Cup)..

In 1764, the standard 18-hole golf course was created at St Andrews when members modified the course from 22 to 18 holes.. The oldest golf tournament in the world, and the first major championship in golf, The Open Championship, is played annually on the weekend of the third Friday in July.Rugby league originated in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire in 1895 and is generally played in Northern England.
A single 'Great Britain Lions' team had competed in the Rugby League World Cup and Test match games, but this changed in 2008 when England, Scotland and Ireland competed as separate nations.. Great Britain is still retained as the full national team.
Super League is the highest level of professional rugby league in the UK and Europe.. It consists of 11 teams from Northern England, and one each from London, Wales and France.The 'Queensberry rules', the code of general rules in boxing, was named after John Douglas, 9th Marquess of Queensberry in 1867, and formed the basis of modern boxing.
Snooker is another of the UK's popular sporting exports, with the world championships held annually in Sheffield.. In Northern Ireland Gaelic football and hurling are popular team sports, both in terms of participation and spectating, and Irish expatriates in the UK and the US also play them.

=== Symbols ===

The flag of the United Kingdom is the Union Flag (also referred to as the Union Jack).
It was created in 1606 by the superimposition of the Flag of England on the Flag of Scotland and updated in 1801 with the addition of Saint Patrick's Flag.. Wales is not represented in the Union Flag, as Wales had been conquered and annexed to England prior to the formation of the United Kingdom.
The possibility of redesigning the Union Flag to include representation of Wales has not been completely ruled out.. The national anthem of the United Kingdom is "God Save the Queen", with "Queen" replaced with "King" in the lyrics whenever the monarch is a man.
Britannia is a national personification of the United Kingdom, originating from Roman Britain.
Britannia is symbolised as a young woman with brown or golden hair, wearing a Corinthian helmet and white robes.. She holds Poseidon's three-pronged trident and a shield, bearing the Union Flag.
Sometimes she is depicted as riding on the back of a lion.. Since the height of the British Empire in the late 19th century, Britannia has often been associated with British maritime dominance, as in the patriotic song "Rule, Britannia!".
Up until 2008, the lion symbol was depicted behind Britannia on the British fifty pence coin and on the back of the British ten pence coin.. It is also used as a symbol on the non-ceremonial flag of the British Army.A second, less used, personification of the nation is the character John Bull.
The bulldog is sometimes used as a symbol of the United Kingdom and has been associated with Winston Churchill's defiance of Nazi Germany.

Other religions comprise less than one percent of Germany's population.A study in 2018 estimated that 38% of the population are not members of any religious organization or denomination, though up to a third may still consider themselves religious.
Irreligion in Germany is strongest in the former East Germany, which used to be predominantly Protestant before state atheism, and in major metropolitan areas.


=== Languages ===

German is the official and predominant spoken language in Germany.. It is one of 24 official and working languages of the European Union, and one of the three procedural languages of the European Commission.
German is the most widely spoken first language in the European Union, with around 100 million native speakers.Recognised native minority languages in Germany are Danish, Low German, Low Rhenish, Sorbian, Romany, North Frisian and Saterland Frisian; they are officially protected by the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages..

Primary education usually lasts for four to six years.. Secondary schooling is divided into tracks based on whether students pursue academic or vocational education.
A system of apprenticeship called Duale Ausbildung leads to a skilled qualification which is almost comparable to an academic degree.. It allows students in vocational training to learn in a company as well as in a state-run trade school.
This model is well regarded and reproduced all around the world.Most of the German universities are public institutions, and students traditionally study without fee payment.. The general requirement for university is the Abitur.
According to an OECD report in 2014, Germany is the world's third leading destination for international study.. The established universities in Germany include some of the oldest in the world, with Heidelberg University (established in 1386) being the oldest.
The Humboldt University of Berlin, founded in 1810 by the liberal educational reformer Wilhelm von Humboldt, became the academic model for many Western universities.. In the contemporary era Germany has developed eleven Universities of Excellence.


=== Health ===

Germany's system of hospitals, called Krankenhäuser, dates from medieval times, and today, Germany has the world's oldest universal health care system, dating from Bismarck's social legislation of the 1880s.
Since the 1880s, reforms and provisions have ensured a balanced health care system.. The population is covered by a health insurance plan provided by statute, with criteria allowing some groups to opt for a private health insurance contract.
According to the World Health Organization, Germany's health care system was 77% government-funded and 23% privately funded as of 2013.. In 2014, Germany spent 11.3% of its GDP on health care.Germany ranked 20th in the world in 2013 in life expectancy with 77 years for men and 82 years for women, and it had a very low infant mortality rate (4 per 1,000 live births).
In 2019, the principal cause of death was cardiovascular disease, at 37%.. Obesity in Germany has been increasingly cited as a major health issue.
A 2014 study showed that 52 percent of the adult German population was overweight or obese.


== Culture ==

Culture in German states has been shaped by major intellectual and popular currents in Europe, both religious and secular.. Historically, Germany has been called Das Land der Dichter und Denker ("the land of poets and thinkers"), because of the major role its writers and philosophers have played in the development of Western thought.
A global opinion poll for the BBC revealed that Germany is recognised for having the most positive influence in the world in 2013 and 2014.Germany is well known for such folk festival traditions as Oktoberfest and Christmas customs, which include Advent wreaths, Christmas pageants, Christmas trees, Stollen cakes, and other practices.. As of 2016 UNESCO inscribed 41 properties in Germany on the World Heritage List.
There are a number of public holidays in Germany determined by each state; 3 October has been a national day of Germany since 1990, celebrated as the Tag der Deutschen Einheit (German Unity Day).

German electronic music gained global influence, with Kraftwerk and Tangerine Dream pioneering in this genre.. DJs and artists of the techno and house music scenes of Germany have become well known (e.g.
Paul van Dyk, Paul Kalkbrenner, and Scooter).


=== Art and design ===

German painters have influenced western art.. Albrecht Dürer, Hans Holbein the Younger, Matthias Grünewald and Lucas Cranach the Elder were important German artists of the Renaissance, Peter Paul Rubens and Johann Baptist Zimmermann of the Baroque, Caspar David Friedrich and Carl Spitzweg of Romanticism, Max Liebermann of Impressionism and Max Ernst of Surrealism.
Several German art groups formed in the 20th century; Die Brücke (The Bridge) and Der Blaue Reiter (The Blue Rider) influenced the development of expressionism in Munich and Berlin.. The New Objectivity arose in response to expressionism during the Weimar Republic.
After World War II, broad trends in German art include neo-expressionism and the New Leipzig School.

Architectural contributions from Germany include the Carolingian and Ottonian styles, which were precursors of Romanesque.. Brick Gothic is a distinctive medieval style that evolved in Germany.
Also in Renaissance and Baroque art, regional and typically German elements evolved (e.g.. Weser Renaissance).
Vernacular architecture in Germany is often identified by its timber framing (Fachwerk) traditions and varies across regions, and among carpentry styles.. When industrialisation spread across Europe, Classicism and a distinctive style of historism developed in Germany, sometimes referred to as Gründerzeit style.
Expressionist architecture developed in the 1910s in Germany and influenced Art Deco and other modern styles.. Germany was particularly important in the early modernist movement: it is the home of Werkbund initiated by Hermann Muthesius (New Objectivity), and of the Bauhaus movement founded by Walter Gropius.
Ludwig Mies van der Rohe became one of the world's most renowned architects in the second half of the 20th century; he conceived of the glass façade skyscraper.. Renowned contemporary architects and offices include Pritzker Prize winners Gottfried Böhm and Frei Otto.German designers became early leaders of modern product design.
The Berlin Fashion Week and the fashion trade fair Bread & Butter are held twice a year.


=== Literature and philosophy ===

German literature can be traced back to the Middle Ages and the works of writers such as Walther von der Vogelweide and Wolfram von Eschenbach.. Well-known German authors include Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Friedrich Schiller, Gotthold Ephraim Lessing and Theodor Fontane.
The collections of folk tales published by the Brothers Grimm popularised German folklore on an international level.. The Grimms also gathered and codified regional variants of the German language, grounding their work in historical principles; their Deutsches Wörterbuch, or German Dictionary, sometimes called the Grimm dictionary, was begun in 1838 and the first volumes published in 1854.Influential authors of the 20th century include Gerhart Hauptmann, Thomas Mann, Hermann Hesse, Heinrich Böll and Günter Grass.
The German book market is the third largest in the world, after the United States and China.. The Frankfurt Book Fair is the most important in the world for international deals and trading, with a tradition spanning over 500 years.
The Leipzig Book Fair also retains a major position in Europe.German philosophy is historically significant: Gottfried Leibniz's contributions to rationalism; the enlightenment philosophy by Immanuel Kant; the establishment of classical German idealism by Johann Gottlieb Fichte, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel and Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling; Arthur Schopenhauer's composition of metaphysical pessimism; the formulation of communist theory by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels; Friedrich Nietzsche's development of perspectivism; Gottlob Frege's contributions to the dawn of analytic philosophy; Martin Heidegger's works on Being; Oswald Spengler's historical philosophy; the development of the Frankfurt School has been particularly influential.


=== Media ===

The largest internationally operating media companies in Germany are the Bertelsmann enterprise, Axel Springer SE and ProSiebenSat.1 Media.. Germany's television market is the largest in Europe, with some 38 million TV households.
Around 90% of German households have cable or satellite TV, with a variety of free-to-view public and commercial channels.. There are more than 300 public and private radio stations in Germany; Germany's national radio network is the Deutschlandradio and the public Deutsche Welle is the main German radio and television broadcaster in foreign languages.

The largest magazines include ADAC Motorwelt and Der Spiegel.. Germany has a large video gaming market, with over 34 million players nationwide.

German cinema has made major technical and artistic contributions to film.
The first works of the Skladanowsky Brothers were shown to an audience in 1895.. The renowned Babelsberg Studio in Potsdam was established in 1912, thus being the first large-scale film studio in the world.
Early German cinema was particularly influential with German expressionists such as Robert Wiene and Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau.. Director Fritz Lang's Metropolis (1927) is referred to as the first major science-fiction film.
After 1945, many of the films of the immediate post-war period can be characterised as Trümmerfilm (rubble film).. East German film was dominated by state-owned film studio DEFA, while the dominant genre in West Germany was the Heimatfilm ("homeland film").
During the 1970s and 1980s, New German Cinema directors such as Volker Schlöndorff, Werner Herzog, Wim Wenders, and Rainer Werner Fassbinder brought West German auteur cinema to critical acclaim.
The Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film ("Oscar") went to the German production Die Blechtrommel (The Tin Drum) in 1979, to Nirgendwo in Afrika (Nowhere in Africa) in 2002, and to Das Leben der Anderen (The Lives of Others) in 2007.. Various Germans won an Oscar for their performances in other films.
The annual European Film Awards ceremony is held every other year in Berlin, home of the European Film Academy.. The Berlin International Film Festival, known as "Berlinale", awarding the "Golden Bear" and held annually since 1951, is one of the world's leading film festivals.
The "Lolas" are annually awarded in Berlin, at the German Film Awards.


=== Cuisine ===

German cuisine varies from region to region and often neighbouring regions share some culinary similarities (e.g.. the southern regions of Bavaria and Swabia share some traditions with Switzerland and Austria).
International varieties such as pizza, sushi, Chinese food, Greek food, Indian cuisine and doner kebab are also popular.
Bread is a significant part of German cuisine and German bakeries produce about 600 main types of bread and 1,200 types of pastries and rolls (Brötchen).. German cheeses account for about 22% of all cheese produced in Europe.
In 2012 over 99% of all meat produced in Germany was either pork, chicken or beef.. Germans produce their ubiquitous sausages in almost 1,500 varieties, including Bratwursts and Weisswursts.
Although wine is becoming more popular in many parts of Germany, especially close to German wine regions, the national alcoholic drink is beer.. German beer consumption per person stands at 110 litres (24 imp gal; 29 US gal) in 2013 and remains among the highest in the world.
German beer purity regulations date back to the 16th century.The 2018 Michelin Guide awarded eleven restaurants in Germany three stars, giving the country a cumulative total of 300 stars.


=== Sports ===

Football is the most popular sport in Germany.. With more than 7 million official members, the German Football Association (Deutscher Fußball-Bund) is the largest single-sport organisation worldwide, and the German top league, the Bundesliga, attracts the second highest average attendance of all professional sports leagues in the world.
The German men's national football team won the FIFA World Cup in 1954, 1974, 1990, and 2014, the UEFA European Championship in 1972, 1980 and 1996, and the FIFA Confederations Cup in 2017.Germany is one of the leading motor sports countries in the world..

=== Government finance ===

Taxation in the United States is levied at the federal, state, and local government levels.
This includes taxes on income, payroll, property, sales, imports, estates, and gifts, as well as various fees.. Taxation in the United States is based on citizenship, not residency.
Both non-resident citizens and Green Card holders living abroad are taxed on their income irrespective of where they live or where their income is earned.. The United States is one of the only countries in the world to do so.In 2010 taxes collected by federal, state and municipal governments amounted to 24.8% of GDP.
Based on CBO estimates, under 2013 tax law the top 1% will be paying the highest average tax rates since 1979, while other income groups will remain at historic lows.. For 2018, the effective tax rate for the wealthiest 400 households was 23%, compared to 24.2% for the bottom half of U.S.
households.

During fiscal year 2012, the federal government spent $3.54 trillion on a budget or cash basis, down $60 billion or 1.7% vs.. fiscal year 2011 spending of $3.60 trillion.
Major categories of fiscal year 2012 spending included: Medicare & Medicaid (23%), Social Security (22%), Defense Department (19%), non-defense discretionary (17%), other mandatory (13%) and interest (6%).The total national debt of the United States in the United States was $18.527 trillion (106% of the GDP) in 2014.. The United States has the largest external debt in the world and the 34th largest government debt as a % of GDP in the world.


=== Military ===

The president is the commander-in-chief of the country's armed forces and appoints its leaders, the Secretary of Defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
The United States Department of Defense administers the armed forces, including the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, and Space Force.. The Coast Guard is run by the Department of Homeland Security in peacetime and by the Department of the Navy during times of war.
In 2008, the armed forces had 1.4 million personnel on active duty.. The Reserves and National Guard brought the total number of troops to 2.3 million.
The Department of Defense also employed about 700,000 civilians, not including contractors.Military service is voluntary, though conscription may occur in wartime through the Selective Service System.. American forces can be rapidly deployed by the Air Force's large fleet of transport aircraft, the Navy's 11 active aircraft carriers, and Marine expeditionary units at sea with the Navy's Atlantic and Pacific fleets.
The military operates 865 bases and facilities abroad, and maintains deployments greater than 100 active duty personnel in 25 foreign countries.

The military budget of the United States in 2011 was more than $700 billion, 41% of global military spending.. At 4.7% of GDP, the rate was the second-highest among the top 15 military spenders, after Saudi Arabia.
Defense spending plays a major role in science and technology investment, with roughly half of U.S.. federal research and development funded by the Department of Defense.
Defense's share of the overall U.S.. economy has generally declined in recent decades, from Cold War peaks of 14.2% of GDP in 1953 and 69.5% of federal outlays in 1954 to 4.7% of GDP and 18.8% of federal outlays in 2011.The country is one of the five recognized nuclear weapons states and possesses the second largest stockpile of nuclear weapons in the world.
More than 90% of the world's 14,000 nuclear weapons are owned by Russia and the United States.


== Law enforcement and crime ==

Law enforcement in the United States is primarily the responsibility of local police departments and sheriff's offices, with state police providing broader services.. Federal agencies such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the U.S.
Marshals Service have specialized duties, including protecting civil rights, national security and enforcing U.S.. federal courts' rulings and federal laws.
State courts conduct most criminal trials while federal courts handle certain designated crimes as well as certain appeals from the state criminal courts.

A cross-sectional analysis of the World Health Organization Mortality Database from 2010 showed that United States "homicide rates were 7.0 times higher than in other high-income countries, driven by a gun homicide rate that was 25.2 times higher." In 2016, the US murder rate was 5.4 per 100,000.. Gun ownership rights, guaranteed by the Second Amendment, continue to be the subject of contention.
The United States has the highest documented incarceration rate and largest prison population in the world.
As of 2020, the Prison Policy Initiative reported that there were some 2.3 million people incarcerated.. The imprisonment rate for all prisoners sentenced to more than a year in state or federal facilities is 478 per 100,000 in 2013.
According to the Federal Bureau of Prisons, the majority of inmates held in federal prisons are convicted of drug offenses.. About 9% of prisoners are held in privatized prisons.
The practice of privately operated prisons began in the 1980s and has been a subject of contention.Capital punishment is sanctioned in the United States for certain federal and military crimes, and at the state level in 30 states.. No executions took place from 1967 to 1977, owing in part to a U.S.
Supreme Court ruling striking down arbitrary imposition of the death penalty.. Since the decision there have been more than 1,300 executions, a majority of these taking place in three states: Texas, Virginia, and Oklahoma.
Meanwhile, several states have either abolished or struck down death penalty laws.. In 2019, the country had the sixth-highest number of executions in the world, following China, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and Egypt.


== Economy ==

According to the International Monetary Fund, the U.S.
GDP of $16.8 trillion constitutes 24% of the gross world product at market exchange rates and over 19% of the gross world product at purchasing power parity (PPP).. The United States is the largest importer of goods and second-largest exporter, though exports per capita are relatively low.
In 2010, the total U.S.. trade deficit was $635 billion.
Canada, China, Mexico, Japan, and Germany are its top trading partners.
From 1983 to 2008, U.S.. real compounded annual GDP growth was 3.3%, compared to a 2.3% weighted average for the rest of the G7.
The country ranks ninth in the world in nominal GDP per capita and sixth in GDP per capita at PPP.. The U.S.
dollar is the world's primary reserve currency.
In 2009, the private sector was estimated to constitute 86.4% of the economy.. While its economy has reached a postindustrial level of development, the United States remains an industrial power.
Consumer spending comprised 68% of the U.S.. economy in 2015.
In August 2010, the American labor force consisted of 154.1 million people (50%).. With 21.2 million people, government is the leading field of employment.
The largest private employment sector is health care and social assistance, with 16.4 million people.. It has a smaller welfare state and redistributes less income through government action than most European nations.The United States is the only advanced economy that does not guarantee its workers paid vacation and is one of a few countries in the world without paid family leave as a legal right.
While federal law does not require sick leave, it is a common benefit for government workers and full-time employees at corporations.. 74% of full-time American workers get paid sick leave, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, although only 24% of part-time workers get the same benefits.
In 2009, the United States had the third-highest workforce productivity per person in the world, behind Luxembourg and Norway.. It was fourth in productivity per hour, behind those two countries and the Netherlands.


=== Science and technology ===

The United States has been a leader in technological innovation since the late 19th century and scientific research since the mid-20th century.
Methods for producing interchangeable parts were developed by the U.S.. War Department by the Federal Armories during the first half of the 19th century.
This technology, along with the establishment of a machine tool industry, enabled the U.S.. to have large-scale manufacturing of sewing machines, bicycles, and other items in the late 19th century and became known as the American system of manufacturing.
Factory electrification in the early 20th century and introduction of the assembly line and other labor-saving techniques created the system of mass production.. In the 21st century, approximately two-thirds of research and development funding comes from the private sector.
The United States leads the world in scientific research papers and impact factor.In 1876, Alexander Graham Bell was awarded the first U.S.. patent for the telephone.
Thomas Edison's research laboratory, one of the first of its kind, developed the phonograph, the first long-lasting light bulb, and the first viable movie camera.. The latter led to emergence of the worldwide entertainment industry.
In the early 20th century, the automobile companies of Ransom E.. Olds and Henry Ford popularized the assembly line.
The Wright brothers, in 1903, made the first sustained and controlled heavier-than-air powered flight.The rise of fascism and Nazism in the 1920s and 30s led many European scientists, including Albert Einstein, Enrico Fermi, and John von Neumann, to immigrate to the United States.. During World War II, the Manhattan Project developed nuclear weapons, ushering in the Atomic Age, while the Space Race produced rapid advances in rocketry, materials science, and aeronautics.The invention of the transistor in the 1950s, a key active component in practically all modern electronics, led to many technological developments and a significant expansion of the U.S.
technology industry.. This, in turn, led to the establishment of many new technology companies and regions around the country such as Silicon Valley in California.
Advancements by American microprocessor companies such as Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), and Intel along with both computer software and hardware companies that include Adobe Systems, Apple Inc., IBM, Microsoft, and Sun Microsystems created and popularized the personal computer.. The ARPANET was developed in the 1960s to meet Defense Department requirements, and became the first of a series of networks which evolved into the Internet.


=== Income, poverty and wealth ===

Accounting for 4.24% of the global population, Americans collectively possess 29.4% of the world's total wealth, and Americans make up roughly half of the world's population of millionaires.
The Global Food Security Index ranked the U.S.. number one for food affordability and overall food security in March 2013.
Americans on average have more than twice as much living space per dwelling and per person as European Union residents, and more than every EU nation.. For 2017 the United Nations Development Programme ranked the United States 13th among 189 countries in its Human Development Index and 25th among 151 countries in its inequality-adjusted HDI (IHDI).Wealth, like income and taxes, is highly concentrated; the richest 10% of the adult population possess 72% of the country's household wealth, while the bottom half claim only 2%.
According to a September 2017 report by the Federal Reserve, the top 1% controlled 38.6% of the country's wealth in 2016.. According to a 2018 study by the OECD, the United States has a larger percentage of low-income workers than almost any other developed nation.
This is largely because at-risk workers get almost no government support and are further set back by a very weak collective bargaining system.. The top one percent of income-earners accounted for 52 percent of the income gains from 2009 to 2015, where income is defined as market income excluding government transfers.
In 2018, U.S.. income inequality reached the highest level ever recorded by the Census Bureau.

After years of stagnation, median household income reached a record high in 2016 following two consecutive years of record growth.
Income inequality remains at record highs however, with the top fifth of earners taking home more than half of all overall income.. The rise in the share of total annual income received by the top one percent, which has more than doubled from nine percent in 1976 to 20 percent in 2011, has significantly affected income inequality, leaving the United States with one of the widest income distributions among OECD nations.
The extent and relevance of income inequality is a matter of debate.Between June 2007 and November 2008, the global recession led to falling asset prices around the world.. Assets owned by Americans lost about a quarter of their value.
Since peaking in the second quarter of 2007, household wealth was down $14 trillion, but has since increased $14 trillion over 2006 levels.. At the end of 2014, household debt amounted to $11.8 trillion, down from $13.8 trillion at the end of 2008.There were about 578,424 sheltered and unsheltered homeless persons in the US in January 2014, with almost two-thirds staying in an emergency shelter or transitional housing program.
In 2011, 16.7 million children lived in food-insecure households, about 35% more than 2007 levels, though only 1.1% of U.S.. children, or 845,000, saw reduced food intake or disrupted eating patterns at some point during the year, and most cases were not chronic.
As of June 2018, 40 million people, roughly 12.7% of the U.S.. population, were living in poverty, with 18.5 million of those living in deep poverty (a family income below one-half of the poverty threshold) and over five million live "in 'Third World' conditions." In 2016, 13.3 million children were living in poverty, which made up 32.6% of the impoverished population.
In 2017, the U.S.. state or territory with the lowest poverty rate was New Hampshire (7.6%), and the one with the highest was American Samoa (65%).


== Infrastructure ==


=== Transportation ===

Personal transportation is dominated by automobiles, which operate on a network of 4 million miles (6.4 million kilometers) of public roads.
The United States has the world's second-largest automobile market, and has the highest rate of per-capita vehicle ownership in the world, with 765 vehicles per 1,000 Americans (1996).. In 2017, there were 255,009,283 non-two wheel motor vehicles, or about 910 vehicles per 1,000 people.The civil airline industry is entirely privately owned and has been largely deregulated since 1978, while most major airports are publicly owned.
The three largest airlines in the world by passengers carried are US-based; American Airlines is number one after its 2013 acquisition by US Airways.. Of the world's 50 busiest passenger airports, 16 are in the United States, including the busiest, Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport.


=== Energy ===

The United States energy market is about 29,000 terawatt hours per year.
In 2005, 40% of this energy came from petroleum, 23% from coal, and 22% from natural gas.. The remainder was supplied by nuclear and renewable energy sources.Since 2007, the total greenhouse gas emissions by the United States are the second highest by country, exceeded only by China.
The United States has historically been the world's largest producer of greenhouse gases, and greenhouse gas emissions per capita remain high.


== Culture ==

The United States is home to many cultures and a wide variety of ethnic groups, traditions, and values.. Aside from the Native American, Native Hawaiian, and Native Alaskan populations, nearly all Americans or their ancestors settled or immigrated within the past five centuries.
Mainstream American culture is a Western culture largely derived from the traditions of European immigrants with influences from many other sources, such as traditions brought by slaves from Africa.. More recent immigration from Asia and especially Latin America has added to a cultural mix that has been described as both a homogenizing melting pot, and a heterogeneous salad bowl in which immigrants and their descendants retain distinctive cultural characteristics.Americans have traditionally been characterized by a strong work ethic, competitiveness, and individualism, as well as a unifying belief in an "American creed" emphasizing liberty, equality, private property, democracy, rule of law, and a preference for limited government.
Americans are extremely charitable by global standards.. According to a 2006 British study, Americans gave 1.67% of GDP to charity, more than any other nation studied.The American Dream, or the perception that Americans enjoy high social mobility, plays a key role in attracting immigrants.
Whether this perception is accurate has been a topic of debate.. While mainstream culture holds that the United States is a classless society, scholars identify significant differences between the country's social classes, affecting socialization, language, and values.
While Americans tend  to greatly value socioeconomic achievement, being ordinary or average is also generally seen as a positive attribute.


=== Literature, philosophy, and visual art ===

In the 18th and early 19th centuries, American art and literature took most of its cues from Europe.. Writers such as Washington Irving, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Edgar Allan Poe, and Henry David Thoreau established a distinctive American literary voice by the middle of the 19th century.
Mark Twain and poet Walt Whitman were major figures in the century's second half; Emily Dickinson, virtually unknown during her lifetime, is now recognized as an essential American poet.. A work seen as capturing fundamental aspects of the national experience and character—such as Herman Melville's Moby-Dick (1851), Twain's The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (1885), F.
Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby (1925) and Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird (1960)—may be dubbed the "Great American Novel."Twelve U.S.. citizens have won the Nobel Prize in Literature, most recently Bob Dylan in 2016.
William Faulkner, Ernest Hemingway and John Steinbeck are often named among the most influential writers of the 20th century.. Popular literary genres such as the Western and hardboiled crime fiction developed in the United States.
The Beat Generation writers opened up new literary approaches, as have postmodernist authors such as John Barth, Thomas Pynchon, and Don DeLillo.The transcendentalists, led by Thoreau and Ralph Waldo Emerson, established the first major American philosophical movement.. After the Civil War, Charles Sanders Peirce and then William James and John Dewey were leaders in the development of pragmatism.
In the 20th century, the work of W.. V.
O.. Quine and Richard Rorty, and later Noam Chomsky, brought analytic philosophy to the fore of American philosophical academia.
John Rawls and Robert Nozick also led a revival of political philosophy.
In the visual arts, the Hudson River School was a mid-19th-century movement in the tradition of European naturalism.. The 1913 Armory Show in New York City, an exhibition of European modernist art, shocked the public and transformed the U.S.
art scene.. Georgia O'Keeffe, Marsden Hartley, and others experimented with new, individualistic styles.
Major artistic movements such as the abstract expressionism of Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning and the pop art of Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein developed largely in the United States.. The tide of modernism and then postmodernism has brought fame to American architects such as Frank Lloyd Wright, Philip Johnson, and Frank Gehry.
Americans have long been important in the modern artistic medium of photography, with major photographers including Alfred Stieglitz, Edward Steichen, Edward Weston, and Ansel Adams.


=== Food ===

Mainstream American cuisine is similar to that in other Western countries.. Wheat is the primary cereal grain with about three-quarters of grain products made of wheat flour and many dishes use indigenous ingredients, such as turkey, venison, potatoes, sweet potatoes, corn, squash, and maple syrup which were consumed by Native Americans and early European settlers.
These homegrown foods are part of a shared national menu on one of America's most popular holidays, Thanksgiving, when some Americans make traditional foods to celebrate the occasion.The American fast food industry, the world's largest, pioneered the drive-through format in the 1940s.. Characteristic dishes such as apple pie, fried chicken, pizza, hamburgers, and hot dogs derive from the recipes of various immigrants.
French fries, Mexican dishes such as burritos and tacos, and pasta dishes freely adapted from Italian sources are widely consumed.. Americans drink three times as much coffee as tea.
Marketing by U.S.. industries is largely responsible for making orange juice and milk ubiquitous breakfast beverages.


=== Music ===

Although little known at the time, Charles Ives's work of the 1910s established him as the first major U.S.
composer in the classical tradition, while experimentalists such as Henry Cowell and John Cage created a distinctive American approach to classical composition.. Aaron Copland and George Gershwin developed a new synthesis of popular and classical music.
The rhythmic and lyrical styles of African-American music have deeply influenced American music at large, distinguishing it from European and African traditions.
Elements from folk idioms such as the blues and what is now known as old-time music were adopted and transformed into popular genres with global audiences.. Jazz was developed by innovators such as Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington early in the 20th century.
Country music developed in the 1920s, and rhythm and blues in the 1940s.Elvis Presley and Chuck Berry were among the mid-1950s pioneers of rock and roll.. Rock bands such as Metallica, the Eagles, and Aerosmith are among the highest grossing in worldwide sales.
In the 1960s, Bob Dylan emerged from the folk revival to become one of America's most celebrated songwriters and James Brown led the development of funk.
More recent American creations include hip hop and house music.. American pop stars such as Elvis Presley, Michael Jackson, and Madonna have become global celebrities, as have contemporary musical artists such as Taylor Swift, Britney Spears, Katy Perry, Beyoncé, Jay-Z, Eminem, Kanye West, and Ariana Grande.


=== Cinema ===

Hollywood, a northern district of Los Angeles, California, is one of the leaders in motion picture production.
The world's first commercial motion picture exhibition was given in New York City in 1894, using Thomas Edison's Kinetoscope.. Since the early 20th century, the U.S.
film industry has largely been based in and around Hollywood, although in the 21st century an increasing number of films are not made there, and film companies have been subject to the forces of globalization.Director D.. W.
Griffith, the top American filmmaker during the silent film period, was central to the development of film grammar, and producer/entrepreneur Walt Disney was a leader in both animated film and movie merchandising.. Directors such as John Ford redefined the image of the American Old West, and, like others such as John Huston, broadened the possibilities of cinema with location shooting.
The industry enjoyed its golden years, in what is commonly referred to as the "Golden Age of Hollywood," from the early sound period until the early 1960s, with screen actors such as John Wayne and Marilyn Monroe becoming iconic figures.. In the 1970s, "New Hollywood" or the "Hollywood Renaissance" was defined by grittier films influenced by French and Italian realist pictures of the post-war period.
In more recent times, directors such as Steven Spielberg, George Lucas and James Cameron have gained renown for their blockbuster films, often characterized by high production costs and earnings.
Notable films topping the American Film Institute's AFI 100 list include Orson Welles's Citizen Kane (1941), which is frequently cited as the greatest film of all time, Casablanca (1942), The Godfather (1972), Gone with the Wind (1939), Lawrence of Arabia (1962), The Wizard of Oz (1939), The Graduate (1967), On the Waterfront (1954), Schindler's List (1993), Singin' in the Rain (1952), It's a Wonderful Life (1946) and Sunset Boulevard (1950).. The Academy Awards, popularly known as the Oscars, have been held annually by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences since 1929, and the Golden Globe Awards have been held annually since January 1944.


=== Sports ===

American football is by several measures the most popular spectator sport; the National Football League (NFL) has the highest average attendance of any sports league in the world, and the Super Bowl is watched by tens of millions globally.
Baseball has been regarded as the U.S.. national sport since the late 19th century, with Major League Baseball (MLB) being the top league.
Basketball and ice hockey are the country's next two leading professional team sports, with the top leagues being the National Basketball Association (NBA) and the National Hockey League (NHL).. College football and basketball attract large audiences.
In soccer, the country hosted the 1994 FIFA World Cup, the men's national soccer team qualified for ten World Cups and the women's team has won the FIFA Women's World Cup four times; Major League Soccer is the sport's highest league in the United States (featuring 23 American and three Canadian teams).. The market for professional sports in the United States is roughly $69 billion, roughly 50% larger than that of all of Europe, the Middle East, and Africa combined.Eight Olympic Games have taken place in the United States.
The 1904 Summer Olympics in St.. Louis, Missouri were the first ever Olympic Games held outside of Europe.
As of 2017, the United States has won 2,522 medals at the Summer Olympic Games, more than any other country, and 305 in the Winter Olympic Games, the second most behind Norway.
While most major U.S.. sports such as baseball and American football have evolved out of European practices, basketball, volleyball, skateboarding, and snowboarding are American inventions, some of which have become popular worldwide.
Lacrosse and surfing arose from Native American and Native Hawaiian activities that predate Western contact.. The most watched individual sports are golf and auto racing, particularly NASCAR.


=== Mass media ===

The four major broadcasters in the U.S.
are the National Broadcasting Company (NBC), Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS), American Broadcasting Company (ABC), and Fox Broadcasting Company (FOX).. The four major broadcast television networks are all commercial entities.
Cable television offers hundreds of channels catering to a variety of niches.. Americans listen to radio programming, also largely commercial, on average just over two-and-a-half hours a day.In 1998, the number of U.S.
commercial radio stations had grown to 4,793 AM stations and 5,662 FM stations.. In addition, there are 1,460 public radio stations.
Most of these stations are run by universities and public authorities for educational purposes and are financed by public or private funds, subscriptions, and corporate underwriting.. Much public-radio broadcasting is supplied by NPR.
NPR was incorporated in February 1970 under the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967; its television counterpart, PBS, was created by the same legislation.. As of September 30, 2014, there are 15,433 licensed full-power radio stations in the U.S.
according to the U.S.. Federal Communications Commission (FCC).Well-known newspapers include The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, and USA Today.
Although the cost of publishing has increased over the years, the price of newspapers has generally remained low, forcing newspapers to rely more on advertising revenue and on articles provided by a major wire service, such as the Associated Press or Reuters, for their national and world coverage.. With very few exceptions, all the newspapers in the U.S.
are privately owned, either by large chains such as Gannett or McClatchy, which own dozens or even hundreds of newspapers; by small chains that own a handful of papers; or in a situation that is increasingly rare, by individuals or families.. Major cities often have "alternative weeklies" to complement the mainstream daily papers, such as New York City's The Village Voice or Los Angeles' LA Weekly.
Major cities may also support a local business journal, trade papers relating to local industries, and papers for local ethnic and social groups.. Aside from web portals and search engines, the most popular websites are Facebook, YouTube, Wikipedia, Yahoo!, eBay, Amazon, and Twitter.More than 800 publications are produced in Spanish, the second most commonly used language in the United States behind English.
